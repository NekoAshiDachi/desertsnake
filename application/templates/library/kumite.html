<h1>Kumite</h1>

<p>Squeeze front body in prepping for blocking/countering, regardless of whether sliding backwards against gyakuzuki or
    stepping all the way back against a mawashigeri. (amos)</p>

<ul>
    <li>stronger hikite, acceleration, angles, staying direct; practice aim</li>
    <li>Kizami: not overturning hips and using one point instead</li>
    <li>Oizuki: full extension and hikite</li>
    <li>Squeeze in prepping for counter, regardless whether sliding backwards or stepping all the way back (amos to top)</li>
</ul>

<p>In gohon, sanbon and ippon kumite, the defender steps back, delivering a block and a counter attack after 5, 3 or 1
    step. This is good for beginners but not ideal for more advanced students. It helps the novice to be comfortable
    with a given distance to the opponent (maai). However, in real kumite stepping back is the worst option. Jiyu
    (ippon) kumite should practice blocks at an angle, to the side (or to the front in de-ai)instead. Okinawan masters
    thought that going forward is the best option, so that’s why most blocks in kata are done moving forward (see notes
    on heian shodan’s bunkai).</p>

<p>The brainwashing for doing kihon practice only in one direction can be overridden by doing kihon at such alternative
    directions or zig-zag.[1]</p>

<h2>Stance</h2>

<li>Land fully on feet.</li>
<li>Fake with arms but be conscious of arms' movements.Front arm moves, back fist remains before chest.</li>
<li>More distance with both legs at once - make sure power is from back leg, that it does not follow front leg.</li>
<li>Forward and back quickly, do not stay in front. Use angles for feint.</li>
<li>Keep front knee towards center of opponent, as if knee also pulling forwards. (https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=727616257291532&fref=nf) As if bending back knee to ground, not shifting weight to front knee.</li>
<li>Squeeze inner thigh muscles for attack, push off back leg without raising front knee.</li>
<li>Step and land front foot with heel first, keep feet low to ground.</li>
<li>Do not fully bend knee.</li>
<li>Both feet and fist land at same time in koukutsu-dachi.</li>
<li>Without taking extra steps, use coiled back leg for next attack without pausing.</li>
<li>Extend front leg out far, toes and ball of foot first.</li>
<li>Use stomp to push back, pulling hip to snap back tension and hikite.</li>
<h2>Punches</h2>
<li>Do not scoop punches or let elbows go out. Punch downwards or from side; turn fist over.</li>
<li>Lands same time as leg, so begins a little earlier - except for landing time, as independent units.</li>
<li>More rotation, front and back.</li>
<li>Fully extend punching arm - hyperextend for pullback. Comes back at roughly same angle.</li>
<li>Control!</li>
<li>Don't bring legs together with attack.</li>

<h2>Kicks</h2>

<li>Control!</li>
<li>Fully extend kick.</li>
<li>Use hips to withdraw more quickly.</li>
<li>Practice spinning hook, jumping/spinning back kick, high side kick, flicking roundhouse kicks.</li>
<li>Back kick</li>
<li>keep knees passing closely together</li>
<li>keep hips straight and not like side kick</li>
<li>Hop while extending kick.</li>
<li>Descending mawashigeri turns hip over.</li>

<h2>Techniques and combinations</h2>

<li>Kizami-gyaku-oizuki: emphasis on distance</li>
<li>Kizamizuki, gyakuzuki, same without settling front foot</li>
<li>Gyakuzuki, step forward gyakuzuki</li>
<li>Cover opponent's face with opposite hand, step in and gyakuzuki</li>
<li>feint forward without moving back foot forward, gyakuzuki</li>
<li>opponent has same foot forward, keep hands in front but step in deep and diagonally for gyakuzuki.</li>
<li>Punch combination to get in very close, step back and mawashi with same foot.</li>
<li>keep rhythm of bounce. Bring front knee up in mawashigeri feint, front mawashigeri to head or switch legs and gyakuzuki.</li>
<li>pretend to do spinning reverse mawashigeri but do regular mawashigeri instead.</li>
<li>pretend to do back mawashigeri but change to reverse mawashigeri.</li>
<li>Reverse mawashigeri then mawashigeri</li>

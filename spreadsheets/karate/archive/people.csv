1,Gichin,Funakoshi,,5,1868-11-10,1957-04-26,0,1,,"As inscribed by Nobuhide Ohama at his memorial: “Funakoshi Gichin (?? ??) Sensei, of karate-do, was born on June 10, 1870, in Shuri, Okinawa. From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under Azato Anko and Itosu Anko. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do. He lived out his eighty-eight years of life and left this world on April 26, 1957. Reinterpreting to-te jutsu, the Sensei promulgated karate-do while not losing its original philosophy. Like <i>bugei</i> (classical martial arts), so too is the pinnacle of karate <i>mu</i> (enlightenment): to purify and make one empty through the transformation from <i>jutsu</i> to <i>do</i>. Through his famous words '???????' (<i>karate ni sente nashi</i>), meaning 'There is no first attack in Karate,' and ???????? (<i>karate wa kunshi no bugei</i>), meaning 'Karate is the martial art of intelligent people,' Sensei helped us to better understand the term <i>jutsu</i>. In an effort to commemorate his virtue and great contributions to modern karate-do as a pioneer, we, his loyal students, organised the Shotokai and erected this monument at the Enkakuji. <i>Kenzen ichi</i>' ('The fist and Zen are one').<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> <strong>Life</strong><br><br> Gichin Funakoshi was born in Shuri, Okinawa on November 10, 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration. His father's name was Gisu.<!--Wiki-->{r=54} As a member of the Tominakoshi family, he was <i>shizoku</i>, a low level of nobility. However, he was forced to work beneath his station, reportedly in the rice paddies, because his alcoholic father wasted the family’s money.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> After entering primary school, he became close friends with the son of Ank? Azato, a <i>t?di</i> (the Okinawan name for karate, also known as <i>t?-te</i>) and Jigen-ry? (sword) master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> Funakoshi began training under Azato, an Okinawan government official, at eleven years old.<!--Redmond-->{r=55} At first, he was Azato's only student.<!--JKA India-->{r=52} Though frequently ill and weak, his training was supplemented by toudi master Anko Itotsu<!--Redmond-->{r=55} and others such as Piechin Kiyuna and Niigaki and Sokon Matsumura,<!--JKA India-->{r=52} following the Okinawan tradition of traveling and learning from many sources. The t?di Funakoshi studied was not as militaristic in training as karate would be by the mid-20th century, and it was practiced as a sport: bare-knuckled competitions occurred from time to time, in which Itotsu reportedly participated.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> As Funakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the abolition of the Japanese topknot, this meant he would be ineligible to attend medical school, despite having passed the entrance examination. Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, he became an assistant teacher. During this time, his relations with the Azato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Azato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank? Azato.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> While teaching “Chinese Classics"" to children in a public school, Funakoshi, following Itotsu’s creation of Pinan kata for middle schools, created and began to teach the Taikyoku kata in elementary schools.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> By the time Funakoshi’s karate was ready for Japanese reception, it was reputedly a synthesis of Okinawan martial arts, coming mainly from both popular styles of t?di at the time: Sh?rei-ry? (Naha-te) and Sh?rin-ry? (Shuri-te)<!--Wiki-->{r=54} Rob Redmond, however, argues that Funakoshi’s karate was mostly from Shuri-te, and that the Naha-te elements came from kata introduced by his students.<!--Redmond-->{r=55} Funakoshi's interpretation of a character in karate to mean ""empty"" was reported to have caused some recoil in Okinawa, prompting him in 1922 to remain in Tokyo indefinitely.<!--Wiki-->{r=54} Yet Redmond points out that as early as 1905, Okinawans were writing the word interchangeably between “T’ang"" (China) and “empty."" But because he was a prolific and popular writer, and because Japan was receptive to that change in its increasing imperialism, he has been credited with that interpretation.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> Funakoshi got osteoarthritis in 1948 and died of colorectal cancer in 1957.<!--Wiki-->{r=54} In reflection of his long life and karate career, Redmond writes, “[Funakoshi] was a clever businessman and marketer. He was a social chameleon who was able to discern the times and take advantage appropriately. ...He was brought to Japan, care for there, and then recruited by the US government all because of his uniquely captivating personality and his well-reputed skill at politics. ...When I look at his picture, I see a sweet old man who came from a simple place who enjoyed his athletic activity so much that he wanted everyone to do it with him. ...Funakoshi was a human being in the right place, at the right time, in the right circumstances, and stepped onto that boat.""<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> A memorial to Gichin Funakoshi was erected by the Shotokai at Engaku-ji, a temple in Kamakura, on December 1, 1968. Designed by Kenji Ogata, the monument features calligraphy by Funakoshi and S?gen Asahina (1891–1979), chief priest of the temple, which reads <i>Karate ni sente nashi</i> (There is no first attack in karate), the second of Funakoshi’s twenty principles. To the right of Funakoshi’s precept is a copy of the poem he wrote on his way to Japan in 1922. A second stone features the inscription by Nobuhide Ohama.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> <strong>Contributions</strong><br><br> Shotokan, the name on the sign posted by Funakoshi's students at his dojo, is derived from Funakoshi's pen name, <i>Shoto</i>, which means ""waving pines.""  In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid poet and philosopher who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would meditate and write his poetry. <i>Kan</i>, which means training hall, or house; thus <i>Shotokan</i> means the ""house of Shoto."" By the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> In 1912,<!--Wiki-->{r=54} he became Chairman of Shobukai, the martial arts association of Okinawa.<!--JKA India-->{r=52}<br><br> On March 6, 1921, Funakoshi led a public performance of karate by Naha First High School students for the visiting Crown Prince Hirohito at the Grand Hall of Shuri Castle. On May 6, 1922, he traveled to Tokyo and introduced karate at the First Budo and Physical Education Exhibition sponsored by the Ministry of Education; under the name “Karate Kenkyukai,"" he also gave lectures and demonstrations in Tokyo. These events led the militaristic Japanese establishment to see karate as useful, and Funakoshi was invited to visit again and stay.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> In 1922, Funakoshi moved to Japan to teach karate.<!--Wiki-->{r=54} When he arrived, Funakoshi, but 4’11"", was 54 years old.  He stayed as a guest of Kano Jigoro, the founder of the first school of Judo, the Kodokan, and taught classes there.  During this time, he began replacing Okinawan names with Japanese names for kata and using Kano’s uniform and belt rank system.<!--Redmond-->{r=55} In 1929, he changed his writing of karate from “China hand"" to “empty hand,""<!--NK Shotokai-->{r=56}. He felt that ""China hand"" would mislead people into thinking that karate directly originated from Chinese boxing, and argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of ""empty"" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.<!--Wiki-->{r=54} In that same year, in his first book <i>Ryukyu Boxing Karate</i>, he changed ""karate-jutsu"" to ""karate-do.""<!--JKA India-->{r=52} {n=Japan Karate Association of India. n.d. 8 Jan. 2014.}<br><br> It is difficult to prove the ways in which Funakoshi might have changed methods in teaching and practicing karate aside from making it more formalized, militaristic, and geared towards large classes.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> From 1924, Funakoshi started teaching Karate at various universities such as Tokyo, Takushoku, Waseda, Todai  and Keio universities.<!--JKA India-->{r=52} In 1930, to promote communication and information exchange among karate-ka, he established Dai-nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai, which changed its name in 1936 to Dai-nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai. From 1936 until his death in 1957, Funakoshi was the first Shoto-kai Chairman. In April of 1958, Dai-nihon Karate-do Shoto-Kai and Dai-nippon Karate-do Shoto-kan were reorganized into the present Nihon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<!--NK Shotokai-->{r=56} It is generally known today as Shotokai, and is the official keeper of Funakoshi’s karate heritage.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> On January 29, 1939, the Shotokan dojo in Zoshigaya, Toshima-ku was built, though it was burnt down on April 29, 1945 in the great Tokyo air raid. In the first year he created the Ten no Kata, Taikyoku Shodan, Taikyoku Nidan, Taikyoku Sandan (check conflict), and Kon no Matsukaze, and throughout this time was the first Shotokan Principal.<!--NK Shotokai-->{r=56}<br><br> After World War II, Funakoshi saw American interest in his Japanese karate the same way he had previously seen Japanese interest in his Okinawan Karate. Once again, he was able to provide the Americans with a demonstration of karate and a short instruction course to those interested.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> His notable students were Hironori ?tsuka, <!--Gigo-->{p=18} (his son), <!--Obata-->{p=17}, Shigeru Egami, <!--Teruyuki-->{p=6}, <!--Asai-->{p=7}, <!--Nakayama-->{p=3}, <!--Nishiyama-->{p=4}, Tsutomu Ohshima, <!--Kase-->{p=11}, Mitsusuke Harada, <!--Kanazawa-->{p=2}, and Won Kuk Lee.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> <strong>Approach</strong><br><br> Mentioning in his own works that some karate movements were too dangerous for children, Funakoshi purportedly removed them without specifying which ones: while sport enthusiasts say that the simplification made techniques more streamlined and powerful, application enthusiasts claim that the removal made the techniques into mere exercise. According to Redmond, the excisions only affected Funakoshi’s creation of the Ten no Kata and the Taikyoku kata and not the rest of the martial art’s content.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}<br><br> Funakoshi was not in favor of competitive karate, and he wrote in his autobiography that competition does not encourage positive traits like humility that are important in a Japanese citizen.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}Nishiyama recalls studying under Funakoshi in the dojo or at the university in the forties and fifties, where Funakoshi and his son Gig? equally shared teaching responsibilities between each other. At the dojo, the training was about 80% kata and 20% kihon, and mistakes in kata would result in repetitions until there were no more mistakes. The first year and a half was spent on <!--Heian Shodan-->{k=2} alone. Funakoshi taught at the university once a week, where the training was much harder.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> <strong>Achievements</strong><br><br> Funakoshi, at 5th dan, had the highest karate rank at that time.<!--Wiki-->{r=54}<br><br> In 1949, his students created the Japan Karate Association ({o=1}), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization;<!--Wiki-->{r=54} this was to provide organizational and financial support for Funakoshi, who, like most true martial arts masters, was not financially successful.<!--Evans-->{r=53}{n=Black Belt Magazine Feb. 1988. 8 Jan. 2014} However, in practice, this organization was led by Masatoshi Nakayama, and Funakoshi was not supportive of all of the changes that the JKA eventually made to his karate style.<!--Wiki-->{r=54} More specifically, his own students, including his son, rejected most of his ideas: his high stances, his kata, his kata’s techniques, his kata’s Japanese names, his methods, his marketing, and his philosophy. They preferred competitions and other kata, and the only similarities to his 1920s karate are in the basic movements of his kata.<!--Redmond-->{r=55})<br><br> Commemorative public karate performances and ceremonies<!--NK Shotokai-->{r=56}:<br> - October 1988: the fiftieth anniversary of Shotokan.<br>- October 1992: the 70th anniversary of Funakoshi bringing karate to Japan.<br> - October 2002: the 80th anniversary of Funakoshi bringing Shotokan to Japan.<br> - April 1998: the 130th anniversary of Funakoshi’s birthday and the 60th anniversary of Shotokan.<br> - October 1998: the 130th anniversary of Funakoshi’s birthday and the 60th anniversary of Shotokan.<br> - March 1, 2009: the 140th anniversary of his birthday and the 70th anniversary of Shotokan.<br> - August 27, 1998: a “Pine of Appreciation"" was planted at Sueyoshi Park, Naha for the 130th anniversary of Funakoshi’s birthday.<br><br> <strong>Publications</strong><br><br> Funakoshi published several books on karate. Before World War II, his books catered to a  militaristic readership: in <i>Tote Jutsu</i> he writes, “The shrunken military is like a folded umbrella; when necessary, it will be expanded to include citizens, so, citizens should practice at home…"" In <i>Rentan Goshin Karate Jutsu</i>, he also writes, “Eternal peace is only a dream, however joyful a dream it may be. War is a method which God gave humans to organize the world."" It was after Japan’s defeat in World War II, the American occupation, and the occupier’s ban on karate that he began to write a new philosophy of <i>karate ni sente nashi</i>: there is no first attack in karate.<!--Redmond-->{r=55}br><br> Funakoshi published an autobiography, <i>Karate-Do: My Way of Life</i>.

2,Hirokazu,Kanazawa,,10,1931-05-03,,1,1,,"Hirokazu Kanazawa (?? ??) is a world-renowned Japanese master of Shotokan karate. He is the Chief instructor and President of the Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation ({o=2}), an organization he founded after he left the Japan Karate Association ({o=1}).<!--Wiki-->{r=58}<br><br> <strong>Life</strong><br><br> Kanazawa was born in Iwate Prefecture, Japan in 1931.<!--Seishin-->{r=59} In high school, he earned a 2nd dan in judo, and after graduation enrolled at Nippon University. However, after seeing students of Takushoku University, the most active university in karate, practicing karate, he switched to their university to learn the art.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60} He decided upon karate because he saw that in karate, size would not be an advantage; he was 18 at the time. He studied under JKA head <!--Matsatoshi Nakayama-->{p=3}, and is now one of the few remaining karateka to have studied under <!--Gichin Funakoshi-->{p=1}.<!--SKIF-->{r=61} He also studied under <!--Hidetaka Nishiyama-->{p=4} and other senior instructors. While advancing in rank, he joined the JKA Instructor Training Program.<!--Seishin-->{r=59}<br><br> In 1956, he graduated from the university.<!--Wiki-->{r=58} In that year, he passed the instructor’s exam.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60} He was among the first to graduate from the instructor training program.<!--Wiki-->{r=58} He joined the JKA and remained a member until leaving it and founding SKIF.<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62}<br><br> During his karate career, Kanazawa has sustained many injuries: two broken hands, broken fingers, and injured shoulder and spine, and stitches over his right eye and right ear. He is quick to point out that these injuries were his own fault.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> Along with expertise in various traditional weaponry, Kanazawa has studied Tai Chi for over thirty years under professor Wong.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60} He has attained the highest possible rank in Tai Chi, and claims that its smooth and flowing movements balance the strong and powerful movements of his karate.<!--Seishin-->{r=59}<br><br> <strong>Contributions</strong><br><br> In 1958, Kanazawa provided much help in getting the JKA approved as a corporation by the Japanese Ministry of Education.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}<br><br> In January 1961, Kanazawa was sent to Hawaii after the Butoku Karate Club requested a replacement instructor from the JKA. Aihara of Waseda University had arrived in July 1959 and taught at the Butoku Karate Club until he stopped teaching in late 1960. When Kanazawa arrived, he established a dojo as one of Hawaii’s first full time instructors, interacted with karate instructors of other styles who were already there, and became the first president of the Hawaii Karate Congress, an organization that existed until the 1990s. Some of his senior students include Francis Fong, Kenneth Funakoshi, Ed Kiyuna, Jimmy Miyaji, Stanley Ono, George Sasano, Harry Tagomori, Victor Takemori, and Eugene Watanabe.<!--Hawaii K Seinenkai-->{r=64}<br><br> In May 1963, Kanazawa left Hawaii to teach in Europe and Japan, returning from time to time to teach. His last visit was in June 2003.<!--Hawaii K Seinenkai-->{r=64}<br><br> In 1966, Kanazawa was sent to Great Britain, receiving his 6th dan while there<!--Shotokan Way-->{r=65} and becoming Chief Instructor of the Karate Union of Great Britain ({o=10}).<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62} His British followers include John van Weenen.<!--Shotokan Way-->{r=65} He also taught in Germany.<!--Seishin-->{r=59} In 1967, he became Chief Instructor of JKA Europe & German Karate Federation. In 1968 he was General Manager of the European team at the World Championship in Mexico.<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62}<br><br> In 1971, he became the JKA Director & General Manager of the International Division of JKA and Shihan at Musashikogyo, Kantogakuin and Kitasato Universities. In 1972, he was General Manager of the Japanese Team at the 2nd WUKO Championship in Paris, France.<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62}<br><br> Kanazawa broke away from the JKA in 1973, leaving it in 1977 and establishing Shotokan Karate-Do International (SKI).<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62} In 1978, he set up SKI as SKIF. SKIF is now the worlds largest Shotokan Karate Association under one chief instructor, having several million members in over 130 countries,<!--SKIF-->{r=61} and he continues to be the Chief Instructor and President<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62} of his own organization. Despite leaving the JKA, he is reported to maintain some ties with former colleagues in that organization.<!--Wiki-->{r=58}<br><br> Kanazawa has done much work in tournaments. He was referee in 1976 in the 1st IAKF World Championship in Los Angeles and the JKA Asia-Oceania Championship in Hong Kong, and chairman of the 1st through 9th SKIF World Championships (1983, 1985, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006).<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62}<br><br> In 1990, Kanazawa demonstrated his art at the 10th Traditional Karate Tournament International, held in Las Vegas. In 1994 and 1995, he demonstrated his art at the 14th and 15th Traditional Karate Tournaments International.<!--Wiki-->{r=58}<br><br> <strong>Approach</strong><br><br> The most important points in Kanazawa’s teaching are breathing, movement and timing. Breathing is foremost because it is the basis of body, mind, and spirit.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> He has developed his punch over time into one with a double <i>kime</i>: a physical focus followed by a speed focus. Kanazawa learned from correspondence with the famous Chinese martial arts teacher Matsuda Ryuchi that apparently, he had subconsciously developed a Chinese kempo punch.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> In defending his changing of kata, Kanazawa states that differences in kata have always existed through schools, personal interpretations, age, and physical capabilities.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> In kumite, he believes that winning technique needs only 60% power if 40% of the opponent’s power is used against him. Concentration of heart, mind, and soul also plays an extremely important part, in that the slightest distortion in thinking can cause serious injury of the practitioner or the opponent. He emphasizes this same concentration in basic forms and movements so that karate’s purpose of defeating the opponent may be attained.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> He has expressed regret over the lack of philosophical development in karate, both in the West and in Japan. He dislikes karate’s development as a sport, particularly as a mainly competitive fighting sport through the JKA. He states that such a trend has privileged it towards young, strong men, a contradiction against his own philosophy of karate being for everybody of all ages.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> Finally, he states, “Karate, through its physical and spiritual training and rigid principles, has taught me to control myself. I am confident that in no matter what kind of situation I am in, I would not carelessly use Karate to defend myself. One must always be in a defensive attitude and avoid entanglements for Karate seeks no advantage. In Karate you start with defense and end with defense.""<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> <strong>Achievements</strong><br><br> After just a year and a half of training, he received shodan rank; after three more years, nidan, and sandan in 1956.<sup>3, 3</sup> (The date of his 4th dan is unknown.) He received 5th dan in 1961,<!--Wiki-->{r=58} 6th dan in 1966, and 7th dan in 1971 (up to this point, all JKA ranks). In 1973, the All Japan Karate Federation gave him 7th dan. The International Martial Arts Federation in 1978 gave him 8th dan, in 1988 9th dan, and in 2001 10th dan.<!--Yama Kai-->{r=62} The website Fighting Master states differently that his 10th dan was given in April 2000 while attending the 7th SKIF World Championships in Bali.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> In 1957, Kanazawa, though nursing a broken wrist, was the first karateka to have won the kumite division in the inaugural year of the notorious All Japan Karate Championship.<!--SKIF-->{r=61} He was not going to compete, but as his mother had come in from the country to watch him, he decided to enter in at least one match. A doctor had to check his injured wrist after each match. Using his left hand to fake and block and saving his bandaged right hand for the precise moment, he won all matches with clear one-point blows.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60} In the following year, he was kumite and kata champion<!--SKIF-->{r=61} in the 2nd All Japan Karate Championship, sharing the kumite title with Takayuki Mikami. Because Mikami and Kanazawa had been classmates and roommates for a long time and knew each other well, they launched a minimal number of attacks, mainly just circling until the time was up; thus, they shared the kumite title.<!--Wiki-->{r=58}<br><br> Kanazawa is the only karateka to have won the JKA All Japan Karate Championships three times in a row. In recent years, his eldest son Nobuaki has continued the winning tradition.<!--Fighting Master-->{r=60}<br><br> <strong>Publications</strong><br><br> Kanazawa has written many books on karate, which notably include: <i>Karate: My life</i> (2003), <i>Karate: The Complete Kata</i> (2010), <i>Karate Fighting Techniques: The Complete Kumite</i> (2004, co-authored), and <i>Black Belt Karate</i> (2006).

He helped establish the Japan Karate Association ({o=1}) and wrote many textbooks on karate, working for almost 40 years, until his death in 1987, to standardize and spread Shotokan karate around the world. He was the first master in Shotokan history to attain the rank of 9th dan while alive and was posthumously awarded the rank of 10th dan.<!--Wiki-->{r=66}<br><br> <strong>Life</strong><br><br> Nakayama was born on April 1913 in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. He was descended from the Sanada clan of Nagano, a clan of highly-skilled kenjutsu instructors.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} His grandfather was Naomichi Nakayama,<!--Wiki-->{r=66} a surgeon in Tokyo and a kenjutsu instructor.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} His father was also named Naomichi Nakayama,<!--Wiki-->{r=66}, and was an army medic and a judoka.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} When his father was assigned to Taipei, Nakayama spent some of his formative years there.<!--Wiki-->{r=66} In his youth, he did kendo, judo, swimming, skiing, tennis, and athletics.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}<br><br> In 1932, Nakayama passed the entrance exams to Takushoku University, intending to continue kendo<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}; but after misreading the schedule, he arrived at a karate class instead.<!--Wiki-->{r=66} He observed university's karateka and was invited to the next class. He would say later, ""I forgot kendo completely.""<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} On joining, he trained under <!--Gichin Funakoshi-->{p=1} and his son <!--Gig?-->{p=18}.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} Nakayama practiced karate for five hours a day. The training under Funakoshi of that time, consisting of fifty or sixty repetitions of a single kata and one thousand blows to a makiwara, was so exhaustive that only ten percent of the students lasted for more than six months.In autumn of 1936, Nakayama and other students of Funakoshi gave the first public exhibition of these new methods of training in a demonstration in the Civic Centre of Tokyo.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}<br><br> In university, Nakayama studied history and Chinese language. He spent three or four months in Manchuria during 1933.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} He graduated from Takushoku University in 1937 and returned to China.<!--Wiki-->{r=66} Through an exchange program<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}, he enrolled in the University of Beijing's Institute of Eastern studies.<!--JKA of India-->{r=52} He remained to work for the Chinese government,<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}, and was a military interpreter during the Japanese occupation of China.<!--Wiki-->{r=66} His stay in China spared him from the horrors of World War II Japan.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}<br><br> In graduating from Takushoku University in 1937, Nakayama decided to devote his life to karate.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} In China, he continued to practice and teach karate, as well as study Chinese martial arts,<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} until withdrawing from the University of Beijing in May 1946 and returning to Japan.<!--JKA of India-->{r=52}<br><br> Along with his role in the JKA, Nakayama also held positions in the Physical Education department of Takushoku University, beginning in 1952, and eventually became head of that department. He was also head of the ski team at the university.<!--Wiki-->{r=66}<br><br>Until his death, Nakayama continued teaching, traveling, writing books on karate,<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} and as Chief Instructor<!--Wiki-->{r=66} watching the JKA grow to a world-wide organization of more than 10 million people in 155 countries.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} He passed away in Tokyo<!--Wiki-->{r=66} in 1987 at seventy-four years of age, just as JKA was reaching a pinnacle.<!--JKA Growth-->{r=69}<br><br> <strong>Contributions</strong><br><br> When Nakayama returned to post-war Japan from China in 1946, he found the dojo in ruins, and that several of his karateka companions had perished.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} He got together with other Shotokan colleages from his university days such as <!--Isao Obata-->{p=1},<!--Wiki-->{r=66}, and the students all moved to the university to train. The first split was already under way, though, as the junior students wanted Nakayama in charge, while the senior students wanted Obata in charge. This was because Nakayama was a full-time professional karate teacher, and Obata, as an architect, was not.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> In 1949, Nakayama and his colleagues established the JKA with Funakoshi as Supreme Master.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} In 1955, a headquarters dojo was built at Yotsuya in Tokyo, spurring the building of JKA branch dojos all across Japan.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} In 1952, Nakayama was head of physical instruction in the JKA.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} 1958,<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} Funakoshi, then 81 years old and remaining honorary head of the JKA, chose Nakayama to be Chief Instructor of the JKA.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63}<br><br> In 1955, with the help of <!--Teruyuki Okazaki-->{p=6}, Nakayama developed the JKA instructor training program.<!--ISKF-->{r=70} According to the JKA, this program is, and always has been, the only karate organization whose full time instructors continue to get together every day for joint practice.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} During the period from 1957-1985 under Nakayama's guidance, the JKA, while greatly expanding its branch dojo throughout Japan, began sending (as early as 1958) some of its most highly-accomplished professional instructors overseas to America, Europe and the Middle East to teach and establish dojos. The JKA was the first karate organization to set up dojo outside Japan, and the only organization to send full time instructors to teach karate at universities. For these reasons the JKA is so prominent and powerful overseas.<!--JKA Growth-->{r=69}<br><br> Nakayama also invented karate’s first match system: the first  JKA All Japan Karate Championship was held at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium in October, 1957, and was attended by so many participants and spectators that the venue was filled to capacity. The 5th JKA All Japan Karate Championship in 1961 was even attended by the Crown Prince of Japan (now the Emperor of Japan).<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67}<br><br> His adaptation of kata and kumite for the match system was a huge success,<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} and students of the large JKA dojo achieved an unmatched series of tournament successes in the 1950s and 1960s.<!--Wiki-->{r=66}<br><br> In 1972, with the help of <!--Hirokazu Kanazawa-->{p=2},<!--Hoitsugan-->{r=71}, Nakayama made his personal dojo in the basement of his apartment building, along with a small dormitory for international karateka.<!--Hoitsugan Dojo-->{r=72} The building was basically built around the dojo, with the Nakayama residence at the top of this 6-story apartment building,<!--Hoitsugan-->{r=71} and is located in Ebisu-Nishi, Tokyo, just around the corner from where the hombu dojo had been for over two decades. He named the dojo <i>Hoitsugan</i> after the name of the first place he stayed at when studying in China. The name most closely translates as “the place where people with similar goals practice and study together” and is a reflection of his desires to develop karate as a means of fostering friendships and improving international relations. Over the years hundreds, if not thousands,<!--Hoitsugan Dojo-->{r=72} have lived there, sometimes for years, to live the budo lifestyle and train under the best instructors, winners of the All Japan and ShotoCup tournaments.<!--Shotokan Way-->{r=73} Today, though the original dormitory is no longer being used today as a living space,<!--Hoitsugan-->{r=71} Kawawada Sensei, with the support of Mrs. Nakayama, continues to carry on the legacy of the Hoitsugan dojo.<!--Hoitsugan Dojo-->{r=72}<br><br> Until his death, Nakayama attended every ISKF Master Camp, a summer camp that invites karate masters from around the world, traditionally  from the United States, Europe, Japan, Africa, and Canada.<!--ISKF-->{r=70}<br><br> After Nakayama's death in 1987, the JKA divided into two factions, which subsequently led to a further splintering within the organization. Many senior JKA instructors left to form their own associations, which include the International Shotokan Karate Federation ({o=3}, Teruyuki Okazaki), Japan Karate Shotokai ({o=6}, <!--Asai-->{p=7}), Japan Shotokan Karate Association ({o=11}, <!--Keigo Abe-->), Shotokan Karate International ({o=2} Hirokazu Kanazawa), and Karatenomichi World Federation ({o=5} <!--Mikio Yahara-->{p=5}). All of these instructors were students of Nakayama's. Other notable students were <!--Keinosuke Enoeda-->{p=8} and Takayuki Mikami.<!--Wiki-->{r=66}<br><br> <strong>Approach</strong><br><br> Nakayama's generation, in practising Judo or Kendo, were accustomed to several types of encounter against a real antagonist; this experience was used in the development of karate.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} In 1956, Nakayama, with Okazaki and other JKA instructors,<!--Wiki-->{r=66} restructured the Shotokan karate training program to into a new method of teaching that was tailored to the level and goals of each student: karate as a physical development tool, as a method of self-defense, and as tournament disciplines. He emphasized the necessity for each aspect of training to be physically and kinesthetically practical, and he scientifically analyzed how to make them so.<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67} For the first time, there emerged the “best” form for each kumite stance, posture and movement, and a clear delineation between the “correct” and “incorrect” way to execute each stance, punch, kick or technique.<!--JKA Growth-->{r=69}<br><br> Nakayama was also a staunch supporter of spreading karate to the world and letting each culture adopt and spread karate in their homelands. He wanted to present karate-do in the context of each country’s culture and in a democratic fashion.<!--ISKF-->{r=70}<br><br> Nakayama valued the spiritual aspects of karate that his teacher Funakoshi Gichin espoused—especially the virtue of modesty and the spirit of harmony. He never tired of teaching, by his example more than his words, that to demonstrate these qualities requires not only a deep sense of propriety, but also a constant remembrance that “there is no first attack in karate.”<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67}<br><br> In actual practice, Nakayama insisted that each technique should demonstrate one’s powerful and wholehearted personal best. He also emphasized that it is crucial to study kihon, kata, and kumite as one. And he continually reminded everyone to keep in mind that “the way of karate we pursue is a bare-handed martial art which we practice with an unwavering heart in a state of emptiness; it is a way of developing the personality.”<!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67}<br><br> <strong>Achievements</strong><br><br> By the time World War II began, Nakayama had attained the rank of 2nd dan. In 1951, Nakayama was promoted to 3rd dan. He gained the rank of 5th dan by 1955, and in 1961, Nakayama was promoted to 8th dan—a remarkable progression, in part made possible by the consensus-based system of higher dan promotion in Japan at the time. He was promoted to 9th dan in the 1980s, becoming the first Shotokan master to be awarded this rank while still living.<!--Wiki-->{r=66}<br><br> <strong>Publications</strong><br><br> Nakayama wrote more than twenty books on karate,<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} and martial arts scholar Donn Draeger was one of Nakayama's well-known co-authors.<!--Wiki-->{r=66} In his later years, he summarized all his techniques and philosophy in the famous 11-volume series <i>Best Karate</i><!--JKA Nakayama-->{r=67}, and the 1965 <i>Dynamic Karate</i> is a major reference work for Shotokan karate.<!--Wrekin-->{r=63} Nakayama's books also include the <i>Practical Karate</i> self-defense series.<br><br> He has also had many video productions credited to him.<!--Wiki-->{r=66}<br> {refs} <!-- <strong>References</strong><br><br> r=66 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masatoshi_Nakayama#cite_note-Abada-2"">""Masatoshi Nakayama.""</a> Wikipedia. 24 Dec. 2013.<br><br> r=67 <a href=""http://www.jka.or.jp/english/about/nakayama.html"">""Master Nakayama Masatoshi.""</a> Japan Karate Association.

4,Hidetaka,Nishiyama,,10,1928-10-10,2008-11-08,0,1,,"Hidetaka Nishiyama (?? ??) was an internationally recognized instructor, author, and administrator who helped to establish the Japan Karate Association ({o=1}) and founded the International Traditional Karate Federation ({o=4}). Nishiyama was one of the last surviving students of <!--Funakoshi-->{p=1}. He was based in the United States of America from 1961 until his death in 2008, and was a pioneer of karate in that country. He was posthumously awarded the rank of 10th dan in karate.<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> <strong>Life</strong><br><br> Nishiyama was born on October 10, 1928, in Tokyo, Japan.<!--Warrener-->{r=57} His father was a lawyer and a kendo master, and he had two sisters, Sumiye and Michiko.<!--Wiki-->{r=74} He started learning kendo in 1933 and judo in 1938.<!--E/B short-->{r=75} Recalling the beginning of his martial arts training, Nishiyama said, ""I began, as is the custom in Japan, on the fifth day of the fifth month at the age of five. I started in kendo.""<!--Warrener-->{r=57} His kendo instructor, M?rio Mochida, had a strong and lasting influence on his development in the martial arts.<!--Wiki-->{r=74} In 1943, Nishiyama was promoted to the rank of shodan in kendo,<!--E/B short-->{r=75} eventually reaching sandan in college until karate became his primary martial art.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> His interest in karate was influenced by a few sources: the desire to learn self-defense,<!--Warrener-->{r=57} Funakoshi's <i>Karate Instruction</i><!--Shotokan Way-->{r=76}, an old book written by a sword master (Nishiyama estimated the book to have been written around 1550), and Akira Kurosawa's <i>Zoku Sugata Sanshiro</i> (1945).<!--Wiki-->{r=74} His attempt to find a karate dojo was difficult <!--E/B 36th AAKF-->{r=77} because at that time, karate was not yet popular,<!--Warrener-->{r=57} while other martial arts, such as judo and kendo, were taught as compulsory classes in Japanese middle schools, similar to American phys-ed classes. But at last, he found Funakoshi's dojo in Tokyo<!--E/B 36th AAKF-->{r=77} in 1943<!--Shotokan Way-->{r=76} and began training in 1944.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> Nishiyama in a 1999 interview says, ""I started training in Funakoshi’s dojo, and the training was mostly kata; I would say about 80% kata and 20% kihon. I remember doing the same kata over and over and over again. In fact, we spent the first year and a half just on <!--Heian Shodan-->{k=2}. ...Master Funakoshi was already very old, I think in his 70’s, so he and his son Yoshitaku ({p=18}) shared the responsibilities of teaching about 50/50. But I remember he was a very serious person and any mistake in the kata we would have to do it over and over again until there were no mistakes.""<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> Nishiyama served in the Imperial Japanese Navy before the end of World War II and was unable to continue his karate training during this brief period. With the war over, he was able to begin studying at university.<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> In 1945, Nishiyama enrolled at Takushoku University<!--E/B short-->{r=75} to study business.<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78} Funakoshi taught at the university once a week, and the rest of the time seniors taught. Nishiyama remembered that ""the training at the college was very hard in comparison to the Funakoshi dojo. As an example, when we would start, we would start with about 200 new students, and our dojo was quite small, so we had to eliminate students. The training was very hard until there were only about 10 left, and then we would go back to normal training. ...Well, even the normal training was hard. We would train before the classes began and then on our lunch time, and then after school till about 8:00 p.m., then we would study, and we did this six days a week. We would all look forward till Sundays as we would only rest, and no training so we could train hard again the next week.""<!--Warrener-->{r=57} He became a member of the university's karate team in 1947.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}, was named team captain<!--ITKF-->{r=79} and elected Chairman of the regional collegiate union team in 1949, and co-founded and chaired the All Japan Collegiate Karate Union in 1950.<!--E/B short-->{r=75} He graduated from Takushoku University in 1951, receiving a Master of Arts degree in economics.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> He had no intention of making karate his life's work, but instructors were so rare—and so bad—that he soon found himself coaching every evening. While the burgeoning college clubs and teams began to coalesce into regional and national organizations, he was traveling, organizing, and administrating. Nishiyama had gone to work for Shell Oil, but he became so busy coaching and traveling for the newly forming JKA that he took a leave of absence from his job and never went back.<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78}<br><br> In July 1961, Nishiyama moved to the United States of America at the invitation of his students from the SAC and founded the All American Karate Federation (AAKF). Though based in Los Angeles, where he had settled with his family, his intense dedication to karate is exemplified in a 1975 description of him ""keeping up a terrible pace: doing administrative work all morning, teaching all afternoon and evening, giving exams and flying to conferences all over the world on weekends, seeing his wife and 3-year-old daughter only at weekday breakfasts.""<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78}<br><br> He passed away on November 7, 2008 in Los Angeles, California<!--ITKF-->{r=79} following a prolonged battle with lung cancer.<!--ISKA-->{r=80} He is survived by his wife, Y?ko, and daughters Yumi, Amy, and Nami.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}  His funeral was held on November 30 at the Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles, with over 500 people in attendance.<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> <strong>Contributions</strong><br><br> In 1949,<!--Wiki-->{r=74} Nishiyama helped establish the Japan Karate Association <!--ITKF-->{r=79}, and his uncle who was a lawyer formed the incorporation.<!--Warrener-->{r=57} He received his MA in economics in 1951 and in the same year was appointed to the JKA's Board of Directors.<!--ITKF-->{r=79} He was appointed the Chief of JKA's Department of Instruction in 1953<!--E/B short-->{r=75} and continued to oversee it until the late 1950s.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> Nishiyama recalled that ""[The JKA Instructors Training Program] was started in 1957 because karate was becoming so popular and we needed instructors to teach. So what we did was take the best from the college team, and these hand-picked graduates were put into the Instructors Training Program. ...I was in charge of the actual teaching on a day-to-day basis. In the beginning it was only one year long, but then it was changed to be two years as one year was just not enough time. ...The first two graduates were Mr. <!--Kanazawa-->{p=2} and Mr. Mikami; after them there were many, including <!--Enoeda-->Mr. {p=8} and <!--Shirai-->Mr. {p=9} and Ochi etc., etc. ...Mr. Kanazawa was exceptional, even though he left the JKA.""<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> In 1952, Nishiyama began teaching karate to US military personnel from the Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a part of a judo, aikido, and karate combat training program that included top martial arts instructors such as Gichin Funakoshi, <!--Nakayama-->{p=3} and <!--Obata-->{p=17}.<!--ITKF-->{r=79} He recalled that ""Mr. Mifune was in charge of Judo, Mr. Tomiki was in charge of Aikido.""<!--Warrener-->{r=57} A year later, United States Air Force General Curtis LeMay<!--E/B short-->{r=75} and Mel Bruno of the SAC<!--Warrener-->{r=57} invited Nishiyama as part of a ten-member Budo Mission from Japan to visit SAC bases in the United States for three months to give further training.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> In an interview in the 1990s, Nishiyama related some of his experiences in teaching. ""We were invited to the American bases to instruct... I was the youngest. Every time we went to the bases we were expected to give demonstrations. These were very tough; I had to break many boards so pretty soon my hands and forearms were in a bad state. This happened 3 or 4 times a day. Eventually I couldn't move my arms."" According to a student of Nishiyama, ""...many times the American instructors would present Mr. Nishiyama with very thick boards that had been soaked in water. Mr. Nishiyama never failed to break these boards and never once asked his seniors to break them for him."" Although this was a difficult time for Nishiyama, it showed him that karate could be spread internationally.<!--E/B 36th AAKF-->{r=77}<br><br> In 1961, according to the ITKF, Nishiyama came to the United States on the invitation of SAC karate students and JKA members residing in the country. That same year, Nishiyama organized the All-American Karate Federation (AAKF) as a nationally based amateur karate organization<!--ITKF-->{r=79} in downtown Los Angeles, California.<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78}<br><br> Nishiyama's establishment of the Los Angeles dojo was actually rather complicated. According to a Shotokai source, it began when Tsutomu Ohshima, a student of Funakoshi's unaffiliated with the JKA, requested Nishiyama to teach in his dojo while he was out of the country. Apparently, in early 1961, the men agreed on the condition that Nishiyama would not affiliate the American dojo with the JKA, whether through organization or technique. But at the least, Nishiyama began to teach the Americans through JKA methodology, and when Ohshima returned in 1962, the result was that the dojo split between the two men: two thirds left with Nishiyama to become the AAKF, and the remaining third left with Ohshima to eventually become Shotokan Karate of America.<!--Shotokai-->{r=53} While the Shotokai source strongly suggests manipulation and guile on Nishiyama's part, the statements of Lester Ingber, a former student of both instructors, suggest otherwise: ""[I had the opportunity to choose between the two when Ohshima returned.] I chose Nishiyama. I liked Ohshima personally, but I felt that Nishiyama had an organization and teaching methodology that was superior.""<!--Ingber-->{r=81}<br><br> In November of 1961, Nishiyama organized, under the control of the AAKF, the first National Karate Championship in Los Angeles.<!--ITKF-->{r=79} In 1965, he organized a cooperative effort that led to the first United States vs. Japan Goodwill Karate Tournament,<!--ITKF-->{r=79} in which the participation of the All Japan Collegiate Karate Team made it into the first official international event.<!--E/B short-->{r=75} Two years later, he wrote a long letter on the state of karate tournaments, published in 1967 by Black Belt magazine, warning of the dangers of unqualified competitors and officials.<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> The next year in 1968, he organized the first World Invitational Karate Tournament held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in conjunction with the Olympic Commemorative Tournament in Mexico City hosted by the Mexico Karate Federation. A conference that took place during the tournament culminated in the formation of an international karate organization that would hold its first World Championship in Tokyo.Unfortunately, the first World Championship in Tokyo (1970) and the second in Paris (1973) resulted in organizational disagreements,<!--ITKF-->{r=79} the effects of political maneuvers between the World Union of Karate-do Organizations (WUKO), the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and the AAKF on one level, and competition between Nishiyama's and Ohshima's schools on another.<!--Shotokai-->{r=53} By 1975, Mason Smith in <i>Sports Illustrated</i> describes the situation as such: ""There are those who think [Nishiyama] is trying to control karate in the U.S., if not in the world. There are those of whom he thinks the same. ...On the one hand is the year-old IAKF, which, it is Nishiyama's feeling, democratically reflects the wishes of the majority of karate people around the world. On the other is the WUKO, dominated by Sasakawa with his French ally Delcourt. The AAU, after a brief honeymoon with the AAKF, has tried to take direct control of amateur karate in the U.S. and represent it internationally and has thrown in with WUKO.""<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78}<br><br> In 1970, during a reorganization of the AAKF towards being the Traditional Karate governing body, the JKA group separated and became the JKA-US part of the AAKF. Nishiyama continued as Chairman of the JKA-US and also as Chairman of the AAKF. In April of that same year, the AAKF became a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> An international meeting in New York City resulted in the formation of the International Amateur Karate Federation (IAKF) with Nishiyama as Executive Director<!--ITKF-->{r=79} in 1974<!--E/B short-->{r=75} as a challenge to the WUKO's claim as the international governing body of amateur karate. The IAKF members were JKA organizations from various countries.<!--Shotokai-->{r=53} Ignoring the AAU and WUKO,<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78} the IAKF held its first World Championship in Los Angeles in 1975.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> In 1973, Nishiyama co-founded the Pan American Karate Union (PAKU) and was elected its first Chairman with the first PAKU Championship held in Rio de Janeiro. In 1976, he oversaw the formation of the Mediterranean Karate Championship Committee and the Bolivian Karate Federation, and a year later, he supported the formation of the Central America/Caribbean Karate Confederation and the Asia/Oceania Amateur Karate Federation.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> In 1976, acting on behalf of the IAKF, he submitted an application to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) seeking Olympic recognition for karate.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> In 1979, in accordance with U.S. Public Law regulating national amateur sports governing bodies, the All American Karate Federation was succeeded by the American Amateur Karate Federation, a public benefit, non-profit corporation with Nishiyama elected as its first President.<!--ITKF-->{r=79} It is now a member of the ITKF, controls national and regional competitions, and provides training seminars throughout the US.<!--E/B 36th AAKF-->{r=77}<br><br> In 1981, Nishiyama lent support to the formation of the South American Karate Confederation and the North American Karate Confederation. <!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> In 1985, the IAKF changed its name to the International Traditional Karate Federation<!--ITKF-->{r=79} because the word “karate” had become a generic term applied to a variety of kicking/punching sports. The ITKF, under Nishiyama’s direction, wanted to make it clear it was the governing body of traditional karate,<!--ITKF-->{r=79} as it was again in competition with the WUKO for IOC recognition and pre-eminence in international karate. The IOC recognized the WUKO in 1985,<!--Shotokai-->{r=53} but two years later confirmed that the ITKF was the governing body for traditional karate.<!--ITKF-->{r=79} In the early 1990s, Nishiyama's refusal to align ITKF with the WUKO caused the IOC to suspend its recognition of WUKO as amateur karate's international governing body. The ITKF and WUKO had been due to merge and form a unified karate organization, but this did not eventuate; on its own, the WUKO eventually became the World Karate Federation (WKF).<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> Nishiyama introduced the new Traditional Karate Training System at the 2005 International Camp in San Diego. At the 2006 and 2007 camps, he added more detailed study of Budo and its connection with the high level techniques required by the art of traditional karate.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> Until illness cut short his activities, Nishiyama kept a hectic schedule of teaching Mondays through Fridays at the National Karate Institute (also known as L.

Central Dojo), traveling to conduct seminars and ranking examinations across the U.S. and around the world, attending all national and international competitions, as well as personally directing the administrative staff of the ITKF International Office and AAKF National Office.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> His notable students were Hiroshi Shirai, Takeshi Oishi, Vincent Cruz, Robert Fusaro, Christopher Smaby, and James Yabe.<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> <strong>Approach</strong><br><br> Nishiyama saw a need to establishing controlling bodies to define and protect karate against those who would exaggerate its physical, sensationalist qualities over its philosophy of karate as a way of life, and against frauds who would financially exploit students' ignorance of karate.<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78} When asked about tae kwon do's greater popularity over karate, he responded in a 1999 interview, ""I don’t know why. I think maybe it is like music: many people can play musical instruments but few can play Beethoven’s music. It is too difficult.""<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> His challenge in America was to teach non-Japanese to understand the Japanese culture. He said that culturally, ""many have done very well like Michael Sado, Yabi, Frank Smith, and Ray Dalke, but they must still learn more. Some are good in one way, and others are good in other ways."" He also defined the spiritual part of karate as an attitude, saying, ""For example, if we want to push through a wall, we must show a strong spirit to increase the power. ...Karate does not follow any particular religion."" In clarifying misconceptions tying samurai bushido to karate-do, he said that while the samurai were employed and professional soldiers, karate-ka are martial artists who do their art in order to become better people.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><Br> Nishiyama stated that getting karate into the Olympics would be both positive and negative for karate. It would be good for the 10% of young karateka who would train harder with it as an Olympic sport, but bad for the other 90% if it became a main focus of karate. It would also be bad if karate had to sacrifice its traditional aspects in order to get into the Olympics by being a more entertaining and lucrative sport for television producers. He said, ""If the definition of karate becomes competition karate, this is not what we are trying to do. Karate is first a martial art. Competition is just one of the ways we train our traditional karate. ...If competition becomes the definition of karate, then we will end up with poor quality karate and the techniques will become ineffective."" The purpose of traditional karate competition is to ""understand body mechanics, understand power and speed of the karate technique, and understand contraction and expansion."" According to Nishiyama, this is why ITKF rules require such understandings in scoring, in contrast to WKF rules that require only that a punch scores to a certain area.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> He also said that ""we must remember that karate is not a science. It is an art. We use the science to improve the art form. I think this can best be explained if we think of a painter or an artist. He must use the brushes, the canvas and the paints to create a beautiful painting, but it is still the man who must do the painting. This is why it is also an art form just like karate.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> In 1975, Nishiyama was described as being ""hard, distant and cool,"" but that ""gut-wrenching workouts with him become a kind of addiction,"" such that when organizational work cut into his teaching time, students were ""hurt, angry, jealous."" On second-and third-degree black belts being asked to demonstrate an attack against him, one has said, ""You know you're not going to get hurt, but you don't want to go in. He'll totally break you down. Crumble your mind. Something comes out of his eyes. Say he demonstrates a kick to your stomach. It just touches you and stops. It doesn't hurt. But your skin burns for hours afterward. He fully extends his arm, knuckles against your breastbone. He just exhales hard and you are knocked back three feet."" The same students have lauded his technical and teaching ability despite the limitations of his English. The writer observing the 1975 class wrote, ""In Japan, they have a phrase for him: a snowcapped volcano. A lot of coldness, a lot of fire."" But later: ""You'd have to be a sweat-drenched worshiper in a gi not to see the joie de vivre.""<!--Sports Illustrated-->{r=78}<br><br> 2005 marked the completion of his over three decade’s long study of Budo and its importance to the art of traditional karate. Despite having a hectic teaching and traveling schedule, he steadfastly pursued the study of the original Karate-do technical training systems in order to better integrate those fundamental concepts into modern methods of instruction.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> Nishiyama has stated that the most important aspect of technical training is to concentrate on body dynamics and the use of the entire body in creating the maximum amount of power. Speed and power are equally important ""as they create shock power when put together."" This shock power, a high focus of energy in short time, is <i>kimi</i>, and is crucial for every move. On cross-training, he has said that it is important to have a strong base of knowledge in one martial art before studying other arts.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> He also said that ""a shodan is someone who knows and can demonstrate basic body movement. A sandan is someone who can apply these body movements."" And when grading a student, he believed in taking into consideration the student's age.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> In judging kata in competitions, he mentioned four qualities: 1) proper use of body dynamics, 2) power in techniques, 3) proper form of each technique, and 4) proper transition in tempo, shifting, and continuation of moves. He mentioned Kanazawa and Mikami as models of very good kata.<!--Warrener-->{r=57}<br><br> <strong>Achievements</strong><br><br> In 1946, Nishiyama was promoted to the rank of shodan in karate, and in 1948 to nidan.<!--E/B short-->{r=75} In 1950, Funakoshi promoted him to sandan. (Date on fourth dan unavailable.) In June 1960, he was promoted to fifth dan.<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> On October 10, 1999, the U.S. National Flag was flown over the Capitol in Washington, D.C. for his 71st birthday,<!--ITKF-->{r=79} and delivered by the Senate to the AAKF offices in Los Angeles. On December 5, 1999, a celebration with many students, relatives, and friends took place at which the flag was formally presented to him, along with a letter accompanying it at the request of Senator Slade Gorton: ""I would like to thank you for your many years of service to this country. Your efforts in bringing the art of Karate to the United States Armed Forces has been immeasurable. On behalf of your grateful students and friends, I wish you the best in your many endeavors.""

He was presented with the <i>Kunyoto</i> (Fourth Order of Merit,<!--ITKF-->{r=79} Gold Rays with Rosette) in a ceremony on the grounds of the Tokyo Imperial Palace<!--Wiki-->{r=74} and decorated with the <i>Zuiho-sho</i> (Order of the Sacred Treasure).<!--ITKF-->{r=79}  It was the first time in the history of Japanese national awards that such recognition was granted to a karateka, and Nishiyama was one of only eleven recipients of the award from outside of Japan that year.<!--ISKA-->{r=80}<br><br> In addition, the Republic of Poland honored him in October 2001 when the President of the Republic of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski, bestowed upon him one of the highest medals in Poland, the Officer’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, on the occasion of the first Traditional Karate World Cup.<!--ITKF-->{r=79}<br><br> On November 1, 2003, the International San Ten Karate Association <!--ISKA-->{r=80}, through Vincent Cruz and the yudansha, formally recognized Nishiyama as tenth dan<!--ISKA-->{r=80} with a certificate whose calligraphy was executed by Eri Takase.<!--Wiki-->{r=74} The ISKA reported that Nishiyama at first tried to turn aside the honor, but was moved by the heartfelt affection of the ISKA leadership.<!--ISKA-->{r=80}<br><br> On October 10, 2009, the ITKF posthumously awarded the rank of tenth dan to Nishiyama; his daughter Nami accepted the honor on his behalf. ITKF Chairman Richard Jorgensen recalled, ""[Nishiyama] always said he never wanted to achieve the level of tenth dan because he believed to do so and acquire the highest rank meant that his learning and his life would be over...he would never accept the rank while he lived.""<!--Wiki-->{r=74}<br><br> <strong>Publications</strong><br><br> In 1960, Nishiyama published his first book, <i>Karate: The Art of Empty-Hand Fighting</i> (co-authored with Richard Brown).

His need to ‘win’ (the actual  battle, not the shiai) was likely the reason why he is termed by some as 'the Japan champion who never won.' He would get disqualified or disallowed techniques as he would often fight with too much ‘shinken shobu’ and did not conform to sport rules. <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=3"">Nakayama</a>, when writing about Yahara in his <i>Best Karate Series</i>, wrote ‘Mikio Yahara is a karateka whose daredevil style of fighting in the midst of a heated contest leaves spectators breathless’.

He rampaged through the world, monopolizing the high rankings in many tournaments, establishing legendary fame.(kwf) he had a competitive career from 1974-84.(empty hand) In over a decade of competition, Yahara distinguished himself as a predatory fighter, monopolizing the high ranks of domestic and international championships. As a Kata World Cup Champion, he is probably most famous for his performance of the Unsu and Empi kata.(wiki) He has also been famed for his brilliant performance of â€˜Unsuâ€™, which is athletic, powerful and brimming with energy.(tsw - profile) ""My favorite Kata are still Unsu and Empi. I really donâ€™t know how to explain why I like them. In Empi, the biggest characteristic for me is koshi no kire, the extremely sharp and quick and dramatic hip movements, the bang-bang-bang, which really fits my need of self-expression. I donâ€™t like the slow-type Kata such as Sochin, which Osaka sensei was excellent at - so we had a very sort of opposite character I suppose, but I really respected him. I guess I am not patient enough to move slowly.""(tsw - interview2) He is known for single-handly defeating 34 local gangsters (yakuza), facing down a gangster with a gun, and turning up for a competition with a knife wound.[5](wiki) Approach

Yahara's sensei's famous quote, ""Karate has no philosophy. My philosophy is to knock my opponent out.""(empty hand) being recognised by M.Nakayama in his best Karate series as a fantastic fighter, where it was said â€˜Mikio Yahara is a karateka whose daredevil style of fighting in the midst of a heated contest leaves spectators breathlessâ€™.(tsw - interview1) His need to â€˜winâ€™ (the actual battle not the shiai) was likely the reason why he is termed by some â€˜the Japan champion who never won!). He would get disqualified or disallowed techniques as he would often fight with too much â€˜Shinken Shobuâ€™ and did not conform to the â€˜sport rulesâ€™. He performs a living kata, but more so a kumite with the feeling of â€˜Jissenâ€™, almost a real battle.(tsw - interview1) The KWFâ€™s philosophy of Karate is that its roots are are based in Bujutsu.(kwf) At a time when Karate is becoming turned increasingly into a sport, the KWF will never stop its commitment to pursue Bujutsu Karate that develops the ability to deliver a killing blow and to defend or attack in an instant. We call this the ability to perform ""Ippon Waza.""(kwf) We accomplish this using the following methods and principles. By forging basic technique or Kihon within Kata, we then train to develop our Kihon technique and movement to the ultimate extreme. Then finally, when this is mastered it becomes an effective Kumite technique. The KWF believes that Kihon, Kata and Kumite are represent a trinity of elements that are united as a single whole.(kwf) The concept of Bujutsu is to defend your life and body against attack with martial techniques, and each technique is a Bujutsu. The word Bu includes the meaning of protect yourself while simultaneously defeating your attacker. Do is supposed to be a very steep and tough path you have to climb to practice and perfect those techniques. This path is the practice, the long repetition, the forging of technique, of body, of mind.(tsw - interview1) To take this path, to enter into this path or way of life, this meant a professional or personal or spiritual meaning-for example to serve as a retainer to the King, or to Sensei Yahara Teaching in Russiaprotect your family, or for promotion of your social status, to establish yourself- because being strong is the key to your own success. Now, in order for you to become strong you have to fight. But for fighting, you have to risk your life. And in order to fight well you need to be in a state of Mu, or nothingness. You canâ€™t be in a state of feeling fear, of wanting to do this or that. This is a state of Shugyo, or mental training, to fulfil your purpose. This is in additional to physical training to improve your technique.(tsw - interview1) There are two elements to being strong- being physically trained and to be mentally trained, and when you fight, you have to be strong in both. Basically to be really strong you have to have both. If you donâ€™t have a strong mentality, you wonâ€™t be able to establish a good technique. For example, I could say, if you get exhausted so you canâ€™t perform a technique, it could show your mental weakness, or on the other hand, if your technique becomes stronger, your confidence improves. So we can say that there are two elements that exist in a symbiotic relationship so that to become stronger you have to train both of them. Under that, there is a correspondence between mental strength and technique- strong technique comes from strong mental training.(tsw - interview1) Therefore training to establish a better technique should include giving you confidence and that confidence is part of a strong mentality, which should nurture you towards setting yourself new targets technically. So the focus on establishing good technique is essential to making people mentally tougher.(tsw - interview1) In Budo, there are certain purposes that you can achieve, everyone has their own purposes, and in order to achieve those purposes, training and improving and perfecting techniques while having a strong mental attitude is important. Without training and polishing both of these, you will not be able to achieve your targets. What you have to do is to eliminate your ego, you have to have the strength to eliminate your own ego, to achieve a state of Mu, if you are to do this, a state of no emotion- no fear, no anger, no emotion attached, and no attachment to life itself.(tsw - interview1) ""Is Ikken Hisatsuâ€ essential to the true understanding of karate as bujitsu?"" Without Ichigeki Hisatsu, I cannot exist. In Ichigeki Hitatsu, this is a life-or-death battle. This is what I do. To perform Shinken Shobu means or can literally be translated to be - if you make a mistake you die, the instant consequence of loosing is death. So what kind of training is required to perform Shiken Shobu? What kind of learning is important in this process? In the old days, Samurai had a sword and once that sword was unsheathed, it was the end - either for his enemy or him.(tsw - interview1) Once the katana is unsheathed, blood will follow, either that of your opponent or yours. Once the sword is unsheathed, itâ€™s the end. Therefore, in a Karate context, my feeling is that if I move, I kill the opponent, or be killed. So, I want to achieve the same level of mental stamina and strength as with Shinken Shobu. Also, for my personal pride, I have to win if I move. And in order to win, I have to kill my enemy.(tsw - interview1) ""Although this is a term many would relate to Chadoâ€™ Ichi-go ichi-e ""one time, one meeting"" is linked to both Zen Buddhism and sometimes Budo. In a life-or-death battle there is no second chance to ""try again."" Would this philosophy accord with your idea of karate?"" (MY) Well, for example in competition these days, if you loose a fight in a competition you can get a consolation match - and I think this is total nonsense. Our way thinking, or in Budo Karate, we canâ€™t imagine having such a rule. Once you are defeated you are finished. Of course behind this, there is a real difference between real fighting and sports matches. What I am actually trying to convey is that you must treat each opportunity as if it is your only one chance - that is why there is a value of meeting people and spending time for the moment together.(tsw - interview1) So in terms of Karate fighting, you must throw your technique as if itâ€™s your one and only chance, and you must do it with full responsibility and without regret, put Mikio Yahara - Chief Instructor of the KWFall your energy into that one technique. For Budoka, having pride is very important, and having that pride is one of the most important things. In a real fight, you actually have to throw away your pride. This is a little bit of a different issue- but from my own experience, if I win, I have the maai and my attack is totally in controlâ€¦I know that even before I attack, my opponent is already defeated. Thatâ€™s how I win.(tsw - interview1) In Nakayama Senseiâ€™s Best Karate Series you demonstrate â€˜Last Chance Techniqueâ€™ as an example kani basami - the â€œcrab clawsâ€. Would you please describe your view of â€˜last chanceâ€™ technique?(tsw - interview2) (MY) If you throw your first attack, this should be as if its your last attack, this is the appropriate, proper attack, the legitimate way. But IF you fail, then this is a very Bushido concept, niku o kirashite, hone o tatsu, this is a sutemi waza, a sacrifice technique: it means you let the opponent slash your flesh, but you break your opponentâ€™s bone. In other words, you are prepared to sacrifice your own body, put yourself in great peril so that you can kill your opponent.(tsw - interview2) In this case, itâ€™s OK if you get hit or knocked down, but it is then essential that you take your opponent down. So with my kani basami, I go down with the opponent, which is a great risk; if I fail to take my opponent down, my opponent will attack back and probably, in this case kani basami cannot be considered real sutemi waza.(tsw - interview2) Sensei Yahara laughingI demonstrated this for my 8th dan- and this was the first time I tried it in 30 years. The way I do it is different from what might be considered the standard way. In my case I kick and at the same time I break the opponentâ€™s center of gravity to bring him down, so there are two different things happening at once.(tsw - interview2) Nakayama sensei categorized kani basami as a sutemi waza, but I donâ€™t regard my kani basami as a sutemi waza.(tsw - interview2) But anyway, the very important thing to remember about sutemi waza is not only the technique, but also the mental commitment - you have to know that you use this attack because you are prepared to die in attempting it.(tsw - interview2) Another thing I wan to stress is that Sutemi waza is not a kind of explanation word for a technique; itâ€™s more like a mental state. No matter what kind of technique you use, if you do it, it means that you are prepared to risk damage to yourself in order to bring down your opponent, that mental attitude is sutemi waza. Sutemi waza is not the name of a category of techniques; itâ€™s a mental attitude for a certain strategy of fighting.(tsw - interview2) KWF is firmly based on the JKA shotokan style of karate-do and its training methods.(empty hand) KWF Karate has a â€˜rawnessâ€™ a sense of the old JKA from the 50â€™s and 60â€™s, and does not conform readily to what some see as modern karate. (tsw - interview1) --kwf profile v-- Known for his leopard-like carriage, beautiful jumping techniques and adaptations, his unique karate style fascinated karateka all over the world.(kwf) The concept behind the Karatenomichi World Federation is that the essence of karate is technical, and that exactly this is where karate starts.(kwf) His karate philosophy is based on the conviction that karate is an art dedicated to developing ippon technique- the ability to deliver a single killing blow, and that Budo is founded on the ability to stake oneâ€™s life in a split second executing an offensive or defensive technique. We strive towards these goals, which are very different from the types of sports karate that are increasingly commonplace.(kwf) I have to emphasize again that the difference in level between the technique at university and the Honbu- that difference is between amateur level and professional level. Nowadays students tend to win competitions and that shows the difference between those days and today. It shows that the level of professional and Sensei Yahara teaching, Sensei Kawasaki performing age-uke amateur are becoming indistinguishable, they are blurring into each other. The reason why is that Karate is turning more into a sports, like a game.(tsw - interview1) Once you enter that path where Karate becomes a sport, you start to loose the idea of the need to be a professional, of what it is to be a professional. Since I know the difference between what is a professional and an amateur, I have to draw a clear line, make a clear distinction between real Karate at a professional level and sports-type Karate by amateurs. It is essential that people understand this difference. I want to preserve and maintain the professional level of techniques, and that is one of the purposes of the KWF.(tsw - interview1) YKU) During championships, the KWF prefer the victor of a match to win by oi-zuki or oi-geri rather than by any other technique; and then only a clean strong blow will result in a point being scored. Why does KWF prefer the oi-zuki or oi-geri? (MY) In sports Karate, often a punch is just from the arm, and a kick is just from the leg, which means you are only using a superficial of the body. The inner dynamism of the fights is lost. However, to launch an effective attack, you have to throw it with all your body behind it and you should be able to do this over some sort of distance. I think oi-zuki and oi-geri are the strongest techniques because you are shifting your weight into the opponent. I would like to stick with those strongest techniques.(tsw - interview2) I would like to bring Karate back to Budo Karate as much as I can and this also means keeping a big distance between opponent so that you can secure your own territory and attack across a distance. If you are throwing a small or superficialKWF Championships, please note Master Kanazawa and Sensei Murakami in the background technique, then you can do this safely across a short distance. But if you are going to generate a very powerful oi-zuki or oi-geri, you are going to need a certain distance to do this in order to generate the power.(tsw -interview2) In this context, you need to have a long maai and in this long maai you can generate very powerful oi-zuki or oi-geri, and the other side of this is that you can generate the ichi-geki you need to down your opponent while protecting yourself.(tsw - interview2) So if you perform a correct oi-geri or oi-zuki, you need the correct maai, a certain amount of distance, and you should use these techniques in shiai- this is the KWF style of shiai. In regular training, training is mainly focused on oi-zuki and oi-geri and rotation of the hips. And recently we have established a system and a curiculum so that people at sandan level are able to achieve that good oi-Gojushiho Shozuki or oi-geri in competition. This is quite an unique style and system compared to other organizations, I think.(tsw - interview2) An effective oi-zuki or oi-geri embody all the necessary body and hip movement.(tsw - interview2) In my case, the purpose of practicing Kata is to reinforce and build up my strength in Kumite. In order to make your Kumite stronger, you must practice Kata, and Kata is the most traditional practice method. My Kata is not for competition purposes; my Kata is for actual fighting training. In my old Unsu video with the JKA, it is said that there is â€œsoulâ€ in Yaharaâ€™s Unsu. The reason why there is soul is because I put my soul into my Kata. I practice Kata to fight. In terms of my mental state, Kumite and Kata are the same.(tsw - interview1) ""You believe that â€œBy forging basic technique or Kihon within Kata, we then train to develop our Kihon technique and movement to the ultimate extreme. Then finally, when this is mastered it becomes an effective Kumite technique.â€ Without effective Kihon can a person still develop a real ability in?"" (MY) Kihon is the form that allows the human body to create maximum power, and to maximize the potential power that can be unleashed by the body. Without correct Kihon, there is no Karate. So correct Kihon means developing a stable form, a platform, a stable movement with balance that can produce the maximum power. If you canâ€™t apply these principles into Kumite movement, that Kumite is not Karate, it becomes sports fighting.(tsw - interview2) The KWF Kihon brings this concept into an extreme form. Some people say that maximizing the Kihon movement slows down the actual speed, for example rotating hips to the limit actually slows down the speed of the technique. The thing is, are you going to win by speed or are you going to hit your with real destructive power? For competition, speed might matter, but in KWF we are focusing on developing power, so in the KWF we are studying how to create and make a massive level of destructive power from technique.(tsw - interview2) Speed is important, but if there is no power, no bang behind the punch or the kick, in a real fight the opponent can hit you back. However, when people see my Karate they see I am very fast. And thatâ€™s an important part. With sports Karate, the main purpose of training is to learn to move fast. But in the KWF, or with my training, the purpose is to generate power, to learn how to compress and contract and expand the body and the speed comes from that, from training to generate maximum power. Thatâ€™s the difference. Therefore the heaviness and destructive power is totally different even if the KWF technique is at the same speed or at a marginally slower speed.(tsw - interview2) If you train to create speed the movement becomes light, and the attack becomes very light. My technique and KWF training is not designed to create speed, it is designed to generate maximum power, and speed automatically comes from this anyway.(tsw - interview2) If you fight against a person who has a sword, if you donâ€™t knock him down, or knock him out with one blow, youâ€™ll get chopped to pieces. So please think about what sort of technique you want to develop if you find yourself in a real fight.(tsw - interview2) (YKU) In contrast to Jiyu Ippon Kumite at dojo level Jiyu Kumite sees opponents being expected to exercise control at every point, as injuring yourself or your opponent is considered symptomatic of poor technique. Could you explain your views please? (MY) If you get injured, it means that your technique is not good enough. If you accidentally injure your opponent, again, that is lack of technique. However, if you attack your opponent to, and you deliberately mean to, injure your opponent that requires great control.(tsw - interview2) ""The KWF perform Jiyu Ippon Kumite where the attacker is expected to knock his or her opponent down with a single blow and that blow only to be stopped by a very strong block. Essentially the whole body must be fully utilised to produce dynamic and extremely strong techniques that are explosively powerful. Do you see Jiyu Ippon Kumite as the proving ground of such training?"" (MY) Jiyu Ippon Kumite is the essence of JKA Kumite and the KWF carries this on this tradition. Jiyu ippon Kumite can be seen in Shiai, and in Jiyu Kumite. It can be seen in everything. But that Jiyu Ippon Kumite has to have perfect Kihon.(tsw - interview2) ""You perform some movements in kata differently to other organisations, for example in Bassai Dai there is no knee raise prior to executing Yama zuki. Is there a reason for this difference?"" Well there is tendency for Kata these days to have become a little bit over decorative, but actually, the original Kata were all quite simple. And actually a lot of unnecessary and extraneous movements have been accreted to Kata over the years. What I am doing in cutting things like the knee raise is taking the Kata back to their older simplicity. However this process is not totally bringing them back to their original forms. I am actually slightly modernizing some elements to fit present needs.(tsw - interview2) kwf - ""Chief Shihan Mikio Yahara."" karatenomichi world federation. accessed 14 Jan. 2014. http://www.kwf.jp/eng/yaharamikio.html wiki - ""List of Shotokan organizations.""

Teruyuki Okazaki studied primarily under Gichin Funakoshi as well as Masatoshi Nakayama. In 1953, Okazaki graduated and was immediately appointed coach of the Takushoku team. Later that year, it was decided that Okazaki would be trained as a ""test case"" for the still formulating JKA Instructor Trainee Program.<br><br>In 1961, Okazaki moved to the United States.

In April 2007 Okazaki proposed, as chief instructor of the ISKF, termination of the ISKF's relationship with the JKA and formed an external independent body. This motion was supported by 25 other countries which continued their relationship with the ISKF and discontinued relations with the JKA. This decision came following Okazaki's concern that the JKA had not been conducting itself in the manner appropriate to the teachings of Master Gichin Funakoshi.<br><br>At the following Canadian National ISKF Championships in Toronto, Canada in October 2007, the ISKF technical committee announced Okazaki's promotion to 10th dan, the highest ranking karate master in the ISKF, and among only a couple others internationally at the time.

He started learning karate in 1956, three years after seeing a promotional video of the <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=o&k=1"">Japan Karate Association</a> (JKA) at Komazawa University. He received 1st dan a year, the 2nd in 1959, and the 3rd in 1961.<br><br>In 1962, he won both the kata and the kumite championships of the JKA, thereby becoming one of those receiving the title 'Grand Champion'.<br><br>He moved to Italy in 1965.

Under his tutelage the Italian karate flourished and many titles went to his students.<br><br>Shirai feels that the self-defence (goshindo) aspect of Shotokan karate has been too much in the shadow of kumite and kata. After moving to Europe, he started refocusing on self-defence and its incorporation in the practise of Shotokan karate. During the last years Shirai has given special goshindo oriented stages in Europe often together with Claudio Ceruti, Massimo Abate, and Angelo Torre.<br><br>For the practise of goshindo, Shirai has developed several kihon training methods focusing on simple, powerful and effective techniques, almost always executed in a frontal stance towards the opponent. Turning, in order to achieve this stable frontal stance, is a basic principle of Shirai's goshindo. In addition to kihon, he developed specific goshindo kata. These kata stress the importance of being able to address an attacker coming from any direction. Several of these kata include grabbing and open hand techniques, elements not so often seen in 'normal' Shotokan karate.<br><br>His graduation history since then his move is as follows: 6th - 1969; 7th - 1974; 8th - 1986, 9th - 1999.

In 1953, aged 15 years, he began training in the martial arts of karate and judo. He initially began studying the Shito-ryu style of karate.<br><br>In 1956, Abe entered the Nihon University in Tokyo, studying engineering, and graduated four years later. He began training at the honbu dojo of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) in 1958 under Masatoshi Nakayama. In an interview in 2000, he said, ""Nakayama Sensei was very serious. He trained us very hard and always encouraged us to not only train hard, but to intellectually study what we were training. He stressed understanding ourselves and being good human beings.""

That same year, he read a book on karate by <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=1"">Gichin Funakoshi</a>, and was inspired to begin studying that art under Funakoshi himself. He also trained under Funakoshi's son, <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=18"">Gigo Funakoshi</a>, before the latter's death in 1945. Genshin Hironishi took on most of the teaching duties from that point. Along with Hironishi, Tadao Okuyama also influenced the young Kase's development in karate. Of his four instructors, Hironishi taught him the longest—six years. Kase had been due to be tested for his 3rd dan in judo, but elected to focus on karate instead.<br><br>In March 1945, during the closing stages of World War II, Kase enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Navy and joined the Kamikaze corps. The war ended, however, before he was required to give up his life for his country. One of his biographers, Martin Fernandez, wrote: ""[Kase] usually says that since he could have died in the war and is alive, he never has a reason to be sad. And this is so, because you can always see him smiling or with a special inner mood."" The Shotokan dojo had been destroyed by bombing, and he was unable to find another karate dojo, so he returned to training in judo for a while. When the Shotokan students regrouped under Funakoshi, however, he rejoined them.<br><br>In 1946, Kase was promoted to 1st dan in Shotokan karate.

From 1965 to 1966, he taught in the United States of America, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In 1967, he taught with Shirai in Italy for several months, and then travelled to France, where he settled in Paris. In 1968, Kase was coach of the French Karate Federation. He went on to teach karate there for almost 20 years in France before deciding to close his dojo in the mid-1980s. Amongst his European students was Steve Cattle, who founded the English Shotokan Academy. He then began travelling around the world to teach karate. Kase was frequently a guest of the former Yugoslav Karate Association, and almost all of the senior Yugoslav karate instructors gained their dan ranks through examinations in which he was involved.<br><br>In 1989, Kase and Shirai founded the World Karate-Do Shotokan Academy (WKSA). Kase has called his style of karate ""Shotokan Ryu Kase Ha,"" meaning Shotokan with Kase's personal touch.

He is 8th dan in JKS, and 6th dan through the All Japan Union.<br><br><strong>Life</strong><br><br>Kagawa was born in Osaka, the younger brother of Masayoshi Kagawa, an All Japan Champion and a JKA instructor in Osaka. He began karate when 17 years old. He studied law in Teikyo University, where <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=10"">Abe</a> was teaching. <br><br>After graduation in 1980, Kagawa attended the JKA Instructor Class.

Shaun Banfield, in interviewing Kagawa, describes Kagawa's telling of Nakayama's one bit of advice to him: ""Sensei laughed here whilst pulling his hand to his hip representing ‘hikite’ without saying a word emphasising that Nakayama Sensei never actually said one word to him the entire time he know him."" Under Asai, through assistance and observation, he learned the relaxed approach to technique; at this time, he also worked on his flexibility. <br><br>During his competitive years, he modeled himself on <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=5"">Yahara</a> Sensei and Yamamoto Sensei.

In 1983, he won 1st place in group kata at the World Cup Karate Championship and 3rd place in group kumite at the IAKF World Championship, in 2nd place in kata and kumite at the 1984 27th JKA All Japan Karate Championship, 1st place in kata and kumite at the 1985 28 JKA All Japan Karate Championship, 1st place in group kata at the 1986 6th WKF World Championship, 3rd place in kumite at the 1989 32nd JKA All Japan Karate Championship, and the title of World Shotokan Karate Champion and 1st place in kata and kumite at the 1999 World JKA Karate Championship.<br><br>On kumite since then, in the Banfield interview, he said, ""Before it was a bit stiller, but still very intense. Before, you didn’t throw as many techniques, you would go for the ippon. Now there’s a lot of movement, a lot of techniques, and it’s all about timing. ...I know that people believe that there is sport karate and there is Traditional karate, and they can see a difference, but all of my team are Traditional Karateka... My belief is that they are the same if done correctly.""<br><br>He is known for Sochin, his kicks, and for emphasizing in his lessons relaxation and sharp kime. His favorite kata, though, is Bassai Dai, which he did for both his 1st and 8th dan exams.

17,Isao,Obata,,5,1904-01-01,1976-01-01,0,1,,"Isao Obata (?? ?) was a pioneering Japanese master of Shotokan karate. He was a senior student of <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=1"">Gichin Funakoshi</a> and was a key figure in the establishment of the <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/sltools/API/getorg.php?o=1"">Japan Karate Association</a> (JKA) under Funakoshi in 1949. Obata also helped introduce karate to the United States of America through his demonstrations of the art to United States Air Force personnel and through his students, most notably Tsutomu Ohshima.<br><br><strong>His Life</strong><br><br>Obata was born in 1904 in the Tokyo area of Japan. His father owned several silk mills in the region, and moved the family to different towns as demanded by his work. As a child, he had a great interest in the martial arts, and left it to his brother, Satoru, to prepare to lead the family business eventually. His father was too busy with his business to have studied the martial arts himself, but was pleased at his son's commitment to karate; one of the family's ancestors had been Obata Nobusada, a famous general and governor under daimyo (feudal lord) Takeda Shingen in the 16th century. At school, Obata trained in judo, kendo, and kyudo (archery). A friend gave him a copy of Gichin Funakoshi's first book on karate, and this sparked Obata's interest in the art.<br><br>Upon completion of his secondary education, Obata gained entry to Keio University. In 1923, Funakoshi accepted a position teaching karate at the university, and Obata would go on to become one of Funakoshi's senior students. The Great Kanto Earthquake struck later that year, destroying most of Tokyo, including Keio University's karate dojo (training hall). The students rebuilt the dojo within a year, however, and training resumed. Over the next few years, Obata assisted Funakoshi with teaching karate at Takushoku University, Waseda University, and Hitotsubashi University (then known as Shoka University). He became the inaugural captain of Keio University's karate club. In 1926, Funakoshi awarded black belt status to his most senior students, including Obata. <br><br>In 1932, Obata travelled to Manchuria, and was to work there for more than 10 years as an economic adviser to the Manchurian Aviation Corporation. During this time, he taught karate privately to a few friends and students, but turned his focus to kyudo. His mother introduced him to a young woman, Miyako, and the two were married in Tokyo by 1935. In 1940, he returned to Tokyo to represent Manchuria at a kyudo tournament, and won the competition. For a time, he was much better known for his expertise in kyudo than in karate.<br><br>During the first few months of World War II, Obata was promoted to the rank of 5th dan in Shotokan karate. When Japan entered the war, Obata's brother Satoru joined the Imperial Japanese Army as an officer. S. Obata had practised judo and was ranked 2nd dan in karate. He died in the bitter fighting for Iwo Jima, and this meant that Obata had to return to Japan to look after his mother and sister. His brother's death affected him deeply, for the two had been very close. With the end of the war, the occupying forces suspended all martial arts training in Japan for three years; it was only then that Obata could resume training under Funakoshi. In the meantime, he worked at international trading company Hirano Seiko.<br><br>In his final years, Obata lived with his wife in the outskirts of Tokyo, spending his days teaching karate or tending to his garden. While officially retired, he continued teaching four nights and four evenings each week at Keio University and Meiji University. His students presented him with a plaque reading: ""Like your nickname, Elephant, you are strong, big and gentle. We thank you for the lessons you have taught us.""<br><br><strong>Karate Career</strong><br><br>On May 27, 1949, Obata, <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=3"">Masatoshi Nakayama</a>, Shigeru Egami, and other colleagues established the Japan Karate Association (JKA) under Funakoshi. Obata was the inaugural Chairman of the JKA, with Funakoshi as Honorary Chief Instructor and Nakayama as Chief Instructor. In 1954, he left the JKA when the organization became increasingly commercial and militaristic in nature. Along with Nakayama, <a href=""http://www.shotokanlibrary.com/profile/?t=p&k=4"">Hidetaka Nishiyama</a>, and others, he began teaching personnel from the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) who were based in Japan. Through Emilio Bruno of the SAC, whom Obata had earlier met through his work at Hirano Seiko, SAC headquarters invited Obata to visit the US to demonstrate his art. For two months in 1953, he flew from base to base, demonstrating Shotokan karate to US military personnel; he then returned to teaching in Japan.<br><br>Obata's master, Funakoshi, died in 1957. While Funakoshi had been honorary head of the JKA, Obata felt that the university karate clubs (Keio, Waseda, Takushoku, Hitotsubashi, and Hosei) most faithfully represented the spirit of Funakoshi's karate. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Obata continued teaching karate to SAC personnel at the Kodokan. In 1968, he visited the US again and was honored by his student Tsutomu Ohshima, who had established the Southern California Karate Association. Another pioneer of karate in California, Dan Ivan, also studied under Obata. In a 1972 interview, Obata expressed disillusionment with the development of karate, saying, ""Karate is dying now. It cannot last longer than a few more decades.""<br><br><i>edited from Wikipedia</i>"

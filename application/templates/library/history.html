<h2 id='origin'>Origin</h2>

<p>As Robert Redmond writes, karate originated in Okinawa centuries ago but its
roots extend to China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim nations.
Most of the exchange was from trade and diplomacy, but at times, visitors
unintentionally washed ashore.

<h3 id='origin_chinese'>China</h3>

<p>Oral histories and a few documents describe the strong influence of Chinese
martial arts on Okinawa during the 18th and 19th centuries. Those arts
historically center around the Shaolin temple in China's Henan province, where
martial artists from different styles sought refuge when they were being hunted
by the Qing Dynasty (which lasted from 1644-1912). Chinese boxing developed
there and spread outwards; these systems, such as
 <a href='#' data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal_white_crane">White Crane</a>, Five Ancestors,
Monk Fist, Dragon Fist, Lion Boxing, Dog Boxing, and Tiger Fist, were what was
then transmitted to the Okinawans.

<h2 id='okinawa'>Okinawa</h2>

<p>Over the centuries, Okinawans and Chinese freely visited and lived in China's
southeastern Fujian province and Okinawa's Naha and Shuri cities. Especially in
Fujian's capital Fuzhou, several forms of <i>gongfu</i> (skill through
perseverance) or <i>quanfa</i> (literally, fist rule, and <i>kenpo</i> in
Japanese) were taught. As Chinese martial artists freely trained under
different systems and instructors, those arts evolved over time, while the
Okinawans preserved the style they had learned within a given period.
<sup><a data-toggle="popover" data-content="Redmond 23-24" href='#redmond'>[1]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>The styles of Okinawan <i>toudi</i> (literally, T’ang
Dynasty hand) that emerged from this interaction came directly from the
Chinese instructors and their time period, rather than specific Okinawan cities.
While most famous toudi practitioners came from Naha (a major port city) and
Shuri (the capital), most karate men by the 19th century were Shuri government
employees, and the two cities were less than a 20-minute walk apart. Their
differences more likely represent different points of time of the same Chinese
martial art, rather than different martial arts altogether. The 1926 designation
of toudi styles as Naha-Te, Shuri-Te, and Tomari-Te is then an anachronistic
attempt to systematize those styles. This <a href='#' data-toggle="modal"
data-target="#modal_genealogy">genealogical map</a> is a good illustration of this,
with the individuals further detailed below.

<h3 id="okinawa_chinese">Chinese instructors</h3>

As Redmond writes, the Okinawans' Chinese martial arts instructors, with the
exception of <a href="">Chinto</a>, were "government officials with diplomatic
status [who] interacted with their high-ranking and wealthy counterparts from
Okinawa." Below are a few influential instructors who contributed to the
development of Okinawan martial arts. Those mainly known for contributions to
kata, such as Chiang Nan (the <a href="">Heians</a>), Kung Hsiang-Chun (<a
href=''>Kushanku</a>), and Chinto (<a href="">Gankaku</a>) are mentioned on
their respective kata page.

<h4 id='okinawa_chinese_xinxian'>Wai Xinxian</h4>

<p>Redmond 20: "Not much is known about this man other than his name
and that he wasa friend and associate of Xie Zhongxiang (below). He is thought
to have taught Monk Fist Boxing in Fuzhou, China to a famous Okinawan instructor
who moved there for a period,but no one is really sure. He is thought by some to
be a little older than Xie Zhongxiang."

<h4 id='okinawa_chinese_zhongxiang'>Xie Zhongxian</h4>

<p>Redmond 21: "Xie Zhongxiang (1852-1930). Known by the
nickname Ryuru Ko, this man was afriend of Wai Xinxian's and taught Gongfu in
Fuzhou as well to Okinawans who traveledto meet him. He was the founder of the
Whooping Crane style of Gongfu and probablystudied White Crane and other systems
- synthesizing them into his own method.

to Okinawans who traveled there."

 colored the Chinese names so the injection of their knowledge and the flow of theirteachings by color would be obvious. As you can see, Matsumura Sokon is a nodethrough which all of the blue lines flowed. AragakiSeisho and Higaonna (or Higashionna
 depending on who you read) Kanryo are both nodes for the red lines that formed so-called Naha style.
redmond 26

There are only four people on the chart who receive both flows: Matsumora Kosaku,Matsumura Sokon, Kenwa Mabuni, and then Nakayama Masatoshi.

The most important missing piece from this chart are the not-so-famous peers of themen listed here. It is the cross-pollination of information between peers, which is a veryreal learning experience for everyone who takes up the martial arts.

<h4 id='okinawa_instructors_funakoshi'>Gichin Funakoshi</h4>

<p>When <a href="{{ url_for('library.person', id=1) }}">Funakoshi</a> learned
Karate, his sensei Itosu and Azato only taught kata.
Kihon and kumite drills as we know today were nonexistent.

<h2>Japan: Ryūha (Schools)</h2>

During the era where Funakoshi, Mabuni, and Miyagi were in ascension in the early 20thCentury, the word Toudi was gradually replaced by the word Karate, which is a moreJapanese word. T'ang was replaced by the kanji meaning "void", "sky", or "empty."
he kanji for "Kara-Te", which means Empty Hand. This way ofwriting it became fashionable in the early 20th Century as JapaneseNationalism was on the rise and interest in things from China wason the decline

<p>It may have been Funakoshi exposure to kendo and its training method that
would lead him to introduce gohon kumite - kendo’s uchikomi.</p>

<p>During the early 20th C, the time of Funakoshi, Mabuni, and Miyagi, with the rise of imperialism and nationalism and
    the decline of interest in China, the word Toudi was gradually replaced by the word Karate, a more Japanese word.
    T'ang was replaced by the kanji meaning "void", "sky", or "empty." 空手 The kanji for "Kara-Te" means Empty Hand.
    Funakoshi made karate more Japanese by incorporating elements of judo and kendo (in particular, kendo’s competition
    style). Most karate practitioners then were kendo experts like Nakayama (Redmond 27, 30).</p>

    <li>Karate in Okinawa PE: elementary school in 1901 and in one high-school in 1905.</li>
    <li>It was only in 1902 when Shintaro Ogawa the commissioner of schools in the Kagoshima Prefecture after witnessing
        an exhibition of Karate submitted a report to the Ministry of Education in Japan about the benefits of the
        training in karate that Karate became a part of the curriculum in schools andbegan to be practiced freely in
        Japan. (JKA India - chief instructors)</li>

<p>Technique names were introduced by that time - there was no relationship between a technique and a single name.
    Okinawan masters didn’t want that because one movement could be more than one technique implied by the name[1].

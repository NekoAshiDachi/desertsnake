<h2 id='origin'>Origin</h2>

<p>As Robert Redmond writes, karate originated in Okinawa centuries ago but its
    roots extend to China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim nations.
    Most of the exchange was from trade and diplomacy, but at times, visitors
    unintentionally washed ashore.
    <sup><a class='citation' data-content="Redmond 17">[1]</a></sup>
</p>

<h3 id='origin_chinese'>China</h3>

<p>Oral histories and a few documents describe the strong influence of Chinese
    martial arts on Okinawa during the 18th and 19th centuries. Those arts
    historically center around the Shaolin temple in China's Henan province, where
    martial artists from different styles sought refuge when they were being hunted
    by the Qing Dynasty (which lasted from 1644-1912). Chinese boxing developed
    there and spread outwards; these systems, such as

    <a href='#' class="modal_youtube" data-youtube_id="qCnZRW7IWoE">Tiger Fist</a>,
    were what was then transmitted to the Okinawans.

<h2 id='okinawa'>Okinawa</h2>

<p>Over the centuries, Okinawans and Chinese freely visited and lived in China's
    southeastern Fujian province and Okinawa's Naha and Shuri cities. Especially in
    Fujian's capital Fuzhou, several forms of <i>gongfu</i> (skill through
    perseverance) or <i>quanfa</i> (literally, fist rule, and <i>kenpo</i> in
    Japanese) were taught. As Chinese martial artists freely trained under
    different systems and instructors, those arts evolved over time, while the
    Okinawans preserved the style they had learned within a given period.
    <sup><a class="citation" data-content="Redmond 23-24">[1]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>The styles of Okinawan <i>toudi</i> (literally, T’ang
    Dynasty hand) that emerged from this interaction came directly from the
    Chinese instructors and their time period, rather than specific Okinawan cities.
    While most famous toudi practitioners came from Naha (a major port city) and
    Shuri (the capital), most karate men by the 19th century were Shuri government
    employees, and the two cities were less than a 20-minute walk apart. Their
    differences more likely represent different points of time of the same Chinese
    martial art, rather than different martial arts altogether. The 1926 designation
    of toudi styles as Naha-Te, Shuri-Te, and Tomari-Te is then an anachronistic
    attempt to systematize those styles.

<h3 id="okinawa_chinese">Chinese instructors</h3>

<p>As Redmond writes, the Okinawans' Chinese martial arts instructors, with the
    exception of <a href="">Chinto</a>, were "government officials with diplomatic
    status [who] interacted with their high-ranking and wealthy counterparts from
    Okinawa." Below are a few influential instructors who contributed to the
    development of Okinawan martial arts. Those mainly known for contributions to
    kata, such as
    Chiang Nan (the <a href="">Heians</a>),
    Kung Hsiang-Chun (<a href=''>Kushanku</a>), and
    Chinto (<a href="">Gankaku</a>)
    are mentioned on their respective kata page.

<h4 id='okinawa_chinese_xinxian'>Wai Xinxian</h4>

<p>Redmond 20: "Not much is known about this man other than his name
    and that he wasa friend and associate of Xie Zhongxiang (below). He is thought
    to have taught Monk Fist Boxing in Fuzhou, China to a famous Okinawan instructor
    who moved there for a period,but no one is really sure. He is thought by some to
    be a little older than Xie Zhongxiang."
    <sup><a class="citation" data-content="McCarthy 32">[2]</a></sup>
</p>

<h4 id='okinawa_chinese_zhongxiang'>Xie Zhongxian</h4>

<p>Redmond 21: "Xie Zhongxiang (1852-1930). Known by the
    nickname Ryuru Ko, this man was afriend of Wai Xinxian's and taught Gongfu in
    Fuzhou as well to Okinawans who traveledto meet him. He was the founder of the
    Whooping Crane style of Gongfu and probably studied White Crane and other systems
    - synthesizing them into his own method.

<p>
    Gichin Funakoshi taught toudi for physical education in an elementary school in 1901,
    and in a high school in 1905. In 1902 Shintaro Ogawa, a school commissioner for
    Kagoshima prefecture, witnessed an exhibition of toudi and reported to the Japanese
    Ministry of Education the benefits of toudi. After that, toudi became a part of schools'
    curricula and began to be practiced freely in Japan (JKA India - chief instructors).<br>
    <small><i>TODO: add citations; more summary of Funakoshi pre-Japan.</i></small></p>

<h2 id="japan">Japan</h2>

<p>
    During the early 20th century, with Japanese imperialism on the rise and its interest
    in China on the decline, the Japanese term <i>karate</i> gradually replaced the Okinawan term
    <i>toudi</i>. <i>T'ang Dynasty hand</i>, which was implied in the Okinawan term, became
    "void", "sky", or "empty". Thus, 空手 (karate) means <i>empty hand</i>.
    <sup><a class="citation" data-content="Redmond 27">[1]</a></sup><br>
</p>

<p>
    In this period, technique names were also introduced. Previously, there was no relationship
    between a technique and a single name, as Okinawan masters did not want the application of a
    given movement to be constrained by a single name.<sup>[1]</sup><br>

<p>
    Gichin Funakoshi, for bringing Shotokan karate to Japan and establishing the first karate dojo,
    is its greatest influence.<sup>[0]</sup> He made the Okinawan art more Japanese by incorporating
    elements from the Japanese arts judo and kendo.
    <sup><a class="citation" data-content="Redmond 30">[1]</a></sup>

    From kendo, he absorbed its competition style, and it may have been Funakoshi's exposure to
    kendo's training method that would lead him to introduce <i>gohon kumite</i> (five-step sparring)--
    <a href='#' class='modal_youtube' data-youtube_id='LYsJKej64TA'>kendo’s uchikomi</a>.

    Most of his Japanese students were kendo experts, too, like

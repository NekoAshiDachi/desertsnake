<h3>Ryūha (Schools)</h3>

<p>Okinawan karate (in Okinawan Toudi - for T’ang Dynasty and “hand”), was not based in city-centered (i.e. Shuri,
    Tomari, Naha) systems. From Toudi came Shotokan, Shito-ryu, Goju-ryu, Shorin-ryu, and Uechi-ryu. The most famous men
    came from Naha and Shuri, but most karate men in 19th C were Shuri government employees. Naha, Shuri, and Tomari are
    also less than a 20 minute walk apart. The names Naha-Te, Shuri-Te, and Tomari-Te weren’t given until 1926 (Redmond
    23-4).

<p>When Funakoshi learned Karate, his sensei Itosu and Azato only taught kata. Kihon and kumite drills as we know today
    were nonexistent. It may have been Funakoshi exposure to kendo and its training method that would lead him to
    introduce gohon kumite - kendo’s uchikomi.</p>

<p>During the early 20th C, the time of Funakoshi, Mabuni, and Miyagi, with the rise of imperialism and nationalism and
    the decline of interest in China, the word Toudi was gradually replaced by the word Karate, a more Japanese word.
    T'ang was replaced by the kanji meaning "void", "sky", or "empty." 空手 The kanji for "Kara-Te" means Empty Hand.
    Funakoshi made karate more Japanese by incorporating elements of judo and kendo (in particular, kendo’s competition
    style). Most karate practitioners then were kendo experts like Nakayama (Redmond 27, 30).</p>

    <li>It was only in 1902 when Shintaro Ogawa the commissioner of schools in the Kagoshima Prefecture after witnessing
        an exhibition of Karate submitted a report to the Ministry of Education in Japan about the benefits of the
        training in karate that Karate became a part of the curriculum in schools andbegan to be practiced freely in
        Japan. (JKA India - chief instructors)</li>

<p>Technique names were introduced by that time - there was no relationship between a technique and a single name.
    Okinawan masters didn’t want that because one movement could be more than one technique implied by the name[1].

<p>This is a genealogical map of the major Shotokan organizations, along with their individual histories. As you can
    see, from the organization JKA came the karate-ka who would later form their own organizations.</p>

<p>Shotokan Scholar is currently a work in progress, but big things are afoot.</p>

<h3>The Scholar</h3>
<p>The creator of this website has been practicing karate for a long time. She started at eight-years-old in Hawaii
    with <a href="http://www.jikc-hq.org/">Japan International Karate Center</a>, under Senseis Roy and Martha
    Woodard, of Soke Hirano Kiyohisa, of Wado-ryu's founder Otsuka Hironori. She later trained under Sensei George
    Sasano of <a href="{{o(1)}}">JKA</a>-era <a href="{{p(2)}}">Hirokazu
    Kanazawa</a>. Upon moving to New York in her twenties, she trained with <a href="{{o(2)}}">
    SKIF</a> under Sensei <a href="{{p(31)}}">Igor Dyachenko</a>, and later on her own with other SKIF students. At last, it seems that she's
    finally found a karate home at Sensei <a href="{{p(32)}}">Richard Amos's</a>
    <a href="{{o(8)}}">WTKO</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of karate, she's tried other martial arts ranging from
    (in rough chronological order) bo staff, sai, iaido, American kempo, tang soo do, jiu-jitsu, fencing, boxing,
    muay thai, and tai chi (enough to know that Shotokan karate's the best one of them allâ€”just kidding!).</p>

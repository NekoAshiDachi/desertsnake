    <p>型 : The kanji character for kata is composed of 3 characters. The one in the upper left means <i>shape.</i> The
        one in the upper right means <i>cut</i>. The bottom character means <i>ground</i>.  A kata is a shape that cuts
        the ground.<br>
        形 : This Japanese kanji is also frequently used for the word \"kata.\" It also means \"shape\" (Redmond 9-10).

                citing McCarthy 38). Also passed on were some documents on vital points, strategies, and herbal remedies.

                specific kata lineage to systems is unknown. Differences between the 2 dominant systems of Okinawan karate
                are because of encounters with the same Chinese martial arts during different time periods (Redmond 17-9).

<p>TODO In China, what we call a kata is referred to as a "quan". In the martial
arts practiced inFuzhou, each quan was considered to be the central training
device of a fighting system.Thus, if you learned a fighting system from an
instructor, you learned the quan for thatsystem and practiced your art through
that quan and exercises that centered around it. The Chinese, unlike many today, d
id not subscribe to the silly notion that we limitourselves to only one system
of fighting out of some misplaced sense of loyalty to oneand only one instructor
during a lifetime. They seem to have felt that different systemswere appropriate
for different situations, and they studied with the instructors who knewthe systems
they wanted to learn.When passing their martial arts to the Okinawans, the
Chinese generally handed overthese quan, some of their documentation on
vital points, strategy, and herbal remedies,and whatever went into the practice
of the quan of which today we are unaware.</p> redmond 18

<p>TODO One of the arts thought to have had
a significant influence over karate was Fujian White Crane, which descended from
Shaolin boxing. We see it today in kata like Sanchin, which was known as "San
Chian" in White Crane</p> wikipedia

    <p>In China, each quan (kata) was a system of gongfu. On Okinawa, they were assimilated into the various personal
        styles of individual Toudi experts. Matsumura Sokon (1797-1889) was a major receiver of Shorin style katas, and
        Arakaki Seisho (1840-1918) and Hia(shi)onna Kanryo (1853-1915) the major receivers of Goju style katas.
        Matsumora Kosaku 1829-1898), Matsumura Sokon, Kenwa Mabuni (Shito-ryu, 1889-1952), and Nakayama Masatoshi (JKA,
        1913-1987) received both Shorin and Goju style katas (Redmond 26 citing shitokai.com/matsumura.html and Cook
        1-46. Kata lineage chart also on Redmond 26).</p>

        Kata is a Japanese term meaning mold, model, style, shape, form, or data-type. A karatekata is a set number of basic techniques arranged in order. The closest relatives of thekarate kata in other sports are shadow boxing, dancing, and gymnastics floor routines.The karate player begins by standing at attention, bowing, and then by stepping in someparticular direction throwing karate techniques. The kata are sort of like pretend fights,and yet each kata does not realistically portray an actual fight. The kanji character forkata is composed of three more simple characters. The one in the upper left means"shape." The one in the upper right means "cut." The bottom character means "ground."A kata is a shape that cuts the ground.型The   Japanese   character,   or   kanji,   for   the   word   "kata."   It   iscomposed of three other more basic characters: shape, cut, andground. It means "shape."

        IntroductionEach kata has a name, as if it were a person. Names such as Bassai, Enpi, Jion, andSochin have been given to them over time. Some of the names are recent Japaneseinventions, but most of them are Okinawan names for which we have no explanationtoday – and the kata are no different themselves. Like their names, some of the kata arerecent inventions, and some of them are very old.We can only read the kanji characters that the names are written with and guess at whatthe person who gave the name was thinking. In some cases, the source of the name isobvious. In other cases, we can only guess at the name of the kata. In fact, in many casesthe kanji characters the name is written with are not known for sure, and different Asianinstructors will write the kata name using different characters. Guessing at the meaningof the kata names is good fun, but hardly scientific.

Most of the kata wepractice come to us from way back in time farther than I would have thought beforedoing this research. Suparinpei (Peichurin), Sanseiryu, Sanchin, Seisan, Kururunfa,Seipai, Nippaipo, Niseishi, Useishi, Unshu, Sochin, Naihanchi, Channan (to become ourPinan), Jutte, and perhaps even Kushanku were either learned in Fuzhou, China or werebrought to Okinawa from that city.

From what I can tell, there are two different types of karate kata in Okinawa from China.Some of them have very typical opening sequences of very tense, very slow middle levelblocking and punching that we associate as being Naha kata today. Others seem toinvolve faster techniques and seem to match with what most people consider Shuri'sstyle. But what I find most surprising is that the more I learn about the original forms ofour kata, the way they were done before the Japanese ever got their hands on them, themore I realize that these kata are difficult to differentiate into "groups."
In China, each of these quan was a system. ...These kata were all individual quan fromexternal styles of Gongfu.
I guess what I am trying to say is that the Shuri/Nahagroupings based on slow vs. fast really doesn't work after you view them as being fromChina. It's more a temporary status they existed in on Okinawa for only 120 years or so.

    <p>About 150 distinct Okinawan and Japanese kata (including revisions and adaptations), most of which came from
        Okinawa. Funakoshi was the first Okinawan to teach karate in Japan. He came up with names in the mainland Tokyo
        dialect to replace Okinawan ones for kata (usually translations rather than new names) in response to Japanese
        nationalism, but not all names were adapted (Redmond 33-4). List of kata by ryu, Okinawan/Japanese location,
        origin (ryu or master), romanized name, kanji or katana, and translation, with caveats on accuracy. Shotokan is
        exclusively Shorin with some of Shito-Ryu’s “Aragaki Kata” (Unsu, Sochin, and Nijushiho). Kata created since the
        1920's have been rejected by most instructors and associations as \"illegitimate,\" whereas in the past students
        were encouraged to create kata. A list of Asai Tetsuhiko’s created katas is on pages 40-1.</p>

    <p>The 100 Okinawan kata became the 21-32 of Shotokan (depending on the school) might have been through these reasons:
        1) Funakoshi did not know all 100 kata, and 2) students chose not to do certain katas or forgot them. The Shotokai
        endorse only the 15 of Funakoshi’s Karate-do Kyohan (Redmond 36-44).</p>

    <p>Nakayama and others studied under Funakoshi and his son (Gigo?). This son is reputed to have invented many of
        today’s methods and for importing from other styles popular kata such as Sochin and Unsu. (Redmond?)

    <p>The three Okinawa-te in the XVIII century <i>(SEE HISTORY PAGE)</i>:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Shuri-te</li>

    <p>Shuri was the seat of government in Okinawa, and Naha the largest port city; Chinese traveled to and stayed in
        those cities, and Okinawans traveled to Fuzhou City, China. Chinto excepted, most of the Chinese were government
        diplomats who interacted with high-ranking and wealthy Okinawan counterparts (Redmond 20-1).</p>

    <p>Since styles were formalized in the 1920s and 30s, dividing kata into Shuri-te, Tomari-te, and Naha-te has been
        revisionist history (Redmond 34).</p>

    <h2><span id="Applications">Applications</span></h2>

    <p>Original and lost applications:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Kata used to contain jujutsu applications that were watered down or discarded with the rise of sport
                karate.</li>
            <li>Funakoshi, mainly teaching Okinawan children, was not very skilled or knowledgeable about inner meanings
                in karate technique. He also might have intentionally watered down techniques to popularize it as a
                sport and make it family friendly (Redmond 29).</li>
        </ul></p>

    <h3><span id="Changes">Changes</span></h3>

    <p>The unspoken rule of: “DON’T CHANGE A KATA”. Funakoshi did break this rule - perhaps one of the reasons he never
        went back to okinawa[1].</p>

    <p>Some of Funakoshi's changes:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>He changed the names for something more japanese-friendly.</li>
            <li>Neko-ashi-dachi -> kokutsu dachi: Shorin-ryu does not have a kokutsu-dachi stance. Shito-ryu and
                Goju-ryu do have kokutsu-dachi but it is more like a zenkutsu-dachi facing the opposite direction (like
                in enpi). A possible explanation for this change is found in [1].</li>
            <li>Mae-geri -> yoko-geri-keage: Okinawan karate is limited to mae-geri and mikazuki-geri (and ushiro geri
                in unsu, and a gedan kekomi in bassai-dai). Even Wado-ryu that splitted from Shotokan around 1929 uses
                mae-geri: keage is a “recent” change, after Funakoshi arrived in Japan. Easier to execute from
                Kokutsu-dachi[1].</li>
        </ul>

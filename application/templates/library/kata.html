    <h1><span id='About Kata'>About Kata</span></h1>

    <p>型 : The kanji character for kata is composed of 3 characters. The one in the upper left means <i>shape.</i> The
        one in the upper right means <i>cut</i>. The bottom character means <i>ground</i>.  A kata is a shape that cuts
        the ground.<br>
        形 : This Japanese kanji is also frequently used for the word \"kata.\" It also means \"shape\" (Redmond 9-10).
    </p>

    <h2><span id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Alternative (possible) method of record-keeping to reading/writing (Redmond 15-6).</li>
            <li>Exchange in 18th-19th C between Okinawa (diplomats, traders) and China (diplomats, travelers, military
                advisors), particularly Fukien Province (SE China).</li>
            <li>In Fuzhou (S China)- several forms of gongfu (Cantonese for skill through perseverance and effort)  or
                quanfa (Mandarin for fist rule/law, pronounced in Japanese as kempo) were practiced.</li>
            <li>Chinese passed on to Okinawans quan (kata), which were central training devices within systems like White
                Crane, Five Ancestors, Monk Fist, Dragon Fist, Lion Boxing, Dog Boxing, and Tiger Fist Boxing (Redmond
                citing McCarthy 38). Also passed on were some documents on vital points, strategies, and herbal remedies.
                </li>
            <li>Chinese modified/revised their practices and didn’t limit themselves to single systems or instructors, so
                specific kata lineage to systems is unknown. Differences between the 2 dominant systems of Okinawan karate
                are because of encounters with the same Chinese martial arts during different time periods (Redmond 17-9).
                </li>
        </ul>

    <p>In China, each quan (kata) was a system of gongfu. On Okinawa, they were assimilated into the various personal
        styles of individual Toudi experts. Matsumura Sokon (1797-1889) was a major receiver of Shorin style katas, and
        Arakaki Seisho (1840-1918) and Hia(shi)onna Kanryo (1853-1915) the major receivers of Goju style katas.
        Matsumora Kosaku 1829-1898), Matsumura Sokon, Kenwa Mabuni (Shito-ryu, 1889-1952), and Nakayama Masatoshi (JKA,
        1913-1987) received both Shorin and Goju style katas (Redmond 26 citing shitokai.com/matsumura.html and Cook
        1-46. Kata lineage chart also on Redmond 26).</p>

    <p>About 150 distinct Okinawan and Japanese kata (including revisions and adaptations), most of which came from
        Okinawa. Funakoshi was the first Okinawan to teach karate in Japan. He came up with names in the mainland Tokyo
        dialect to replace Okinawan ones for kata (usually translations rather than new names) in response to Japanese
        nationalism, but not all names were adapted (Redmond 33-4). List of kata by ryu, Okinawan/Japanese location,
        origin (ryu or master), romanized name, kanji or katana, and translation, with caveats on accuracy. Shotokan is
        exclusively Shorin with some of Shito-Ryu’s “Aragaki Kata” (Unsu, Sochin, and Nijushiho). Kata created since the
        1920's have been rejected by most instructors and associations as \"illegitimate,\" whereas in the past students
        were encouraged to create kata. A list of Asai Tetsuhiko’s created katas is on pages 40-1.</p>

    <p>The 100 Okinawan kata became the 21-32 of Shotokan (depending on the school) might have been through these reasons:
        1) Funakoshi did not know all 100 kata, and 2) students chose not to do certain katas or forgot them. The Shotokai
        endorse only the 15 of Funakoshi’s Karate-do Kyohan (Redmond 36-44).</p>

    <p>Nakayama and others studied under Funakoshi and his son (Gigo?). This son is reputed to have invented many of
        today’s methods and for importing from other styles popular kata such as Sochin and Unsu. (Redmond?)

    <p>The three Okinawa-te in the XVIII century <i>(SEE HISTORY PAGE)</i>:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Shuri-te</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Shorin-ryu</li>
                <li>Shotokan</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wado-ryu</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Naha-te</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shito-ryu</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Tomari-te</li>
            <li>Naha-te</li>
        </ul>
    <small>[wikipedia]</small></p>

    <p>Shuri was the seat of government in Okinawa, and Naha the largest port city; Chinese traveled to and stayed in
        those cities, and Okinawans traveled to Fuzhou City, China. Chinto excepted, most of the Chinese were government
        diplomats who interacted with high-ranking and wealthy Okinawan counterparts (Redmond 20-1).</p>

    <p>Since styles were formalized in the 1920s and 30s, dividing kata into Shuri-te, Tomari-te, and Naha-te has been
        revisionist history (Redmond 34).</p>

    <h2><span id="Applications">Applications</span></h2>

    <p>Original and lost applications:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Kata used to contain jujutsu applications that were watered down or discarded with the rise of sport
                karate.</li>
            <li>Funakoshi, mainly teaching Okinawan children, was not very skilled or knowledgeable about inner meanings
                in karate technique. He also might have intentionally watered down techniques to popularize it as a
                sport and make it family friendly (Redmond 29).</li>
        </ul></p>

    <h3><span id="Changes">Changes</span></h3>

    <p>The unspoken rule of: “DON’T CHANGE A KATA”. Funakoshi did break this rule - perhaps one of the reasons he never
        went back to okinawa[1].</p>

    <p>Some of Funakoshi's changes:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>He changed the names for something more japanese-friendly.</li>
            <li>Neko-ashi-dachi -> kokutsu dachi: Shorin-ryu does not have a kokutsu-dachi stance. Shito-ryu and
                Goju-ryu do have kokutsu-dachi but it is more like a zenkutsu-dachi facing the opposite direction (like
                in enpi). A possible explanation for this change is found in [1].</li>
            <li>Mae-geri -> yoko-geri-keage: Okinawan karate is limited to mae-geri and mikazuki-geri (and ushiro geri
                in unsu, and a gedan kekomi in bassai-dai). Even Wado-ryu that splitted from Shotokan around 1929 uses
                mae-geri: keage is a “recent” change, after Funakoshi arrived in Japan. Easier to execute from
                Kokutsu-dachi[1].</li>
        </ul>
